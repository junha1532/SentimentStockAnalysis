Here's an example of a scenario where it would be good, you can invert the circumstances to see when it would be bad.


Assume for a moment you're the CEO of a major company.  Your job is to deliver value to your shareholders. You find yourself in a situation where markets broadly are down, but the crisis putting everyone in ""risk off"" mode doesn't impact your company.  From the opinions of you, your board of directors, and your financial analysts, your company is *very* undervalued in the market currently.  In addition, due to a lack of appealing new projects to invest in, your company is, at the moment, quite cash rich.  So how do you best deliver value to your investors and make use of that cash?


1.  You could start paying dividends.  This can work, but there are downsides.  It forces a taxable event in all your investors.  In addition, dividends often come with the expectation that they will continue, and you don't necessarily think that this cash rich, no projects situation will continue.


2.  You could invest in new projects.  Generally this is exactly what shareholders want you doing, but for one reason or another, there aren't a lot of good RoI projects available at the moment.


3.  You could pay down debt.  Appealing if you're extremely over leveraged, but if your debt is super cheap, AND a tax deduction what shareholder is going to be happy you made it go away?


4.  You can buy back shares.  You feel your stock is undervalued, so you'd get a great RoI on the buyback.  It only creates a taxable event for those shareholders who opt to participate in the tender.  It drives up your stock price and doesn't imply any future payments, because this time next year you might very well want to put that cash in to projects.",18

I can't speak to all of them, but a lot of them were extremely risky moves.

For some firms it'll pay off big, for some it'll sink them.

Why?

What do you think happens to the pilots, aircraft, and everything to an airline when it goes bankrupt? Do you think they execute the pilots and burn the aircraft?

The pilots still exist. When a bankruptcy happens, the bondholders (usually banks) take over the company. Even if the company enters liquidation, the aircrafts (and other assets) are sold to the next company, usually for cheap.

3/19/2020 16:56,Because we tried letting the banks fail in 2008 and it almost sunk the wider economy. We dont need a repeat of tiptoeing on the brink of the abyss. If needed jail the managers and take equity stakes in the company which would be equivalent to wiping out the current shareholders.

3/19/2020 16:57,"Airlines wouldn't really fail fail as in there's no more airlines. A couple maybe, but they would just be bought up at a big discount and consolidated. If airlines were still a viable business (they are), berkshire or someone could float a couple the money to keep the lights on while the others failed. There's not really a need for a government bailout, imo.

Keeping these massive discount airlines that are run really horribly but undercut all the solid companies pretty much forces the solid companies to cut tons of corners to stay in business. If you let the frontier airline types fail, the better companies could perhaps raise prices a little and stop cutting corners.

3/19/2020 22:26,"> How much money did the stock buy backs make long term investors? All those prices have fallen to pre buy back levels.

If they had sold their stock after the buy back they'd have made as much as those who got dividends.

If they had held their stock until today, then they'd have lost as much money as they would have if they had been paid dividends.  It isn't like dividend-paying stocks were spared the last few weeks.

> If anything you payed more to buy stock thatâ€™s be inflated. 

Obviously if you buy the stock AFTER a buyback is announced you're going to pay a higher price.  The same is true if you buy a stock after a dividend is announced.

Buybacks reward the current investors in a company, not future ones.  That makes sense, since they're the ones who owned the company when it earned the money that allowed the buyback.

> With dividends sure you might pay more in taxes but thatâ€™s money your getting every month or quarter. Long term that adds up and can often allow you to grow account without having to sell your original position to see profit.

Who cares if you have to sell your original position to see profit?

With a dividend you get a check for $100.  With a buyback your holdings increase in value by $100.  If you don't want $100 right now in the first case you have to buy more stock to reinvest it.  If you do want $100 right now in the second case you can just sell some stock.

Either way you can get cash at any time if you want it.

> Buy backs especially the buybacks weâ€™ve seen do basically jack shit for long term investors looking to hold. It just pumped up the market and burned cash for nothing. 

You seem to be assuming that the only reason stock prices dropped in the last few weeks was due to buybacks.

If those companies hadn't bought back stock they'd likely be worth even less today than they are.  So stockholders still have value from the buyback even after the crash.

If you do the math a buyback and dividend are basically the same thing.  They just return money to shareholders in different ways.

> most people arenâ€™t actively managing their accounts 

Nor should they.  If a buyback made their account worth 10% more than it would have otherwise been, then today their account is probably still worth 10% more than it would have otherwise been.  And if they'd re-invested dividends they'd be in the exact same place, with 10% more stock than they'd otherwise have had but at a lower per-share price.

I get that people are upset that stock prices have fallen.

In any case, I completely support banning buybacks OR dividends with bailout money, and I think bailouts should be in the form of a loan.  Once the loan is repaid the company can do as it wishes.  That is just reasonable because the government should be bailing out companies for the purpose of keeping the economy going for the public benefit, not just giving cash to shareholders.  Dividends are just as inappropriate.

And don't get me wrong - there probably are a lot of inappropriate buybacks out there.  I don't actually think that it is good for a company to just sit on mountains of cash, and I don't have a problem with financing on debt either.  However, at the same time I also don't agree with short-sighted buybacks to sate impatient shareholders when there are better opportunities for a company to internally invest.  And of course if a company has fundamental issues with profitability it should be considering major restructuring/etc and not just borrowing money to give shareholders and executives golden parachutes, or hiding systemic issues.

Plenty of companies are mismanaged. I don't think that is a problem with buybacks.  I think it is a symptom of the limitations of financial statements and analysis, and that shareholders aren't able to properly value companies.",1

The government can choose to restrict any of those. And during the financial crisis, the government got smarter with each subsequent bailout they did.

3/19/2020 23:14,"Summary of Goldman Sachs Investor call where 1,500 companies dialed in. The key economic takeaways were:

50% of Americans will contract the virus (150m people) as it's very communicable. This is on a par with the common cold (Rhinovirus) of which there are about 200 strains and which the majority of Americans will get 2-4 per year.

70% of Germany will contract it (58M people). This is the next most relevant industrial economy to be effected. 

Peak-virus is expected over the next eight weeks, declining thereafter.

The virus appears to be concentrated in a band between 30-50 degrees north latitude, meaning that like the common cold and flu, it prefers cold weather. The coming summer in the northern hemisphere should help. This is to say that the virus is likely seasonal.

Of those impacted 80% will be early-stage, 15% mid-stage and 5% critical-stage. Early-stage symptoms are like the common cold and mid-stage symptoms are like the flu; these are stay at home for two weeks and rest. 5% will be critical and highly weighted towards the elderly. 

Mortality rate on average of up to 2%, heavily weight towards the elderly and immunocompromised; meaning up to 3m people (150m*.02). In the US about 3m/yr die mostly due to old age and disease, those two being highly correlated (as a percent very few from accidents). There will be significant overlap, so this does not mean 3m new deaths from the virus, it means elderly people dying sooner due to respiratory issues. This may however stress the healthcare system. 

There is a debate as to how to address the virus pre-vaccine. The US is tending towards quarantine. The UK is tending towards allowing it to spread so that the population can develop a natural immunity. Quarantine is likely to be ineffective and result in significant economic damage but will slow the rate of transmission giving the healthcare system more time to deal with the case load. 

Chinaâ€™s economy has been largely impacted which has affected raw materials and the global supply chain. It may take up to six months for it to recover. 

Global GDP growth rate will be the lowest in 30 years at around 2%. 

S&P 500 will see a negative growth rate of -15% to -20% for 2020 overall. 

There will be economic damage from the virus itself, but the real damage is driven mostly by market psychology. Viruses have been with us forever. Stock markets should fully recover in the 2nd half of the year.

In the past week there has been a conflating of the impact of the virus with the developing oil price war between KSA and Russia. While reduced energy prices are generally good for industrial economies, the US is now a large energy exporter, so there has been a negative impact on the valuation of the domestic energy sector. This will continue for some time as the Russians are attempting to economically squeeze the American shale producers and the Saudiâ€™s are caught in the middle and do not want to further cede market share to Russia or the US.

Technically the market generally has been looking for a reason to reset after the longest bull market in history. 

There is NO systemic risk. No one is even talking about that. Governments are intervening in the markets to stabilize them, and the private banking sector is very well capitalized. It feels more like 9/11 than it does like 2008.",999

The problem with getting government involved with shares too, is people are seeing it as a return on investment.

With government heavily invest, they would be more prone to injecting more money to ensure they investment stayed a float (over other business), causing favouritism.

A lot of businesses will not be coming back and unemployment will continue to remain high through next year. This will be a long L-shaped recovery and not a V or an U shape.

> According to a study uploaded to the medical pre-print server MedRxiv on Monday, it appears that a correlation exists between warm weather and a decrease in the transmission rate of the coronavirus.

> If the climate conditions are extremely cold or very hot and humid, the virus is â€œlargely absent,â€ the study showed. The results of the study were reported by Bloomberg News on Monday.

> According to the study, people in tropical and polar climates are unlikely to see local transmission of COVID-19 cases.

> Researchers wrote that between June and September, much of Europe and North America should see a slowing rate of infections.

> Another study, by Beijing-based researchers, uploaded to the pre-print server arXiv last week came to a similar conclusion. It should be noted that neither study has been reviewed by other researchers.

> A study published in 2011 that looked at other coronaviruses also showed that higher temperatures and humidity tend to result in the viruses dying more quickly.",10

3/20/2020 3:47,"Let's have a little chat about what Covid-19 is. And let's start with the term betacoronavirus. 

So back when I was learning about *betacoronaviruses* (January, thanks for joining us), I read me some big sciency things. 

[Like this](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/av/2011/734690/).

That's an article done on a Covid-19's fellow betacoronavirus, and 79.5%+ similar genetic material sharer as SARS. And, bonus points, mine source doesn't quote Beijing! 

Good news if you're looking to scroll through it for ways to say you're right on the internet instead of learning something: It talks about lowered rates of transmission for Covid-19 in heat! In humidity! In Tropical climates!

Small problem with both your source and mine, tho:

>High relative humidity (>95%) at comparatively low temperature (28Â°C and 33Â°C) did not affect the virus infectivity significantly (Figure 2(a)). High temperature (38Â°C) at 80â€“90% relative humidity led to a 0.25~2 loss of titre at 24 hr (Figure 2(b)). However, if the dried virus was stored at high temperature (38Â°C) and high relative humidity (>95%), there was a further ~1.5  loss of titre for each time point up to 24 hr (0.38~3.38  ) when compared with high temperature (38Â°C) at a lower relative humidity 80â€“90% (Figures 3(a)â€“3(c)). 

In short, both hot and humid barely slow it down. And SARS? Had about 8000 total global cases. 

We're at over 30,000+ confirmed cases in the last 24 hours alone. So, this seems to be just a little bit more infectious, wouldn't you say?

There's further findings within that say that AC weather means this shit will spread like crazy. Someone coughs or develops the rare sneeze and gets that right into that cool, wet stream OH BABY, you've got a stew going. 

So, if you're all the way over lil ole me asking for math in a *bank's projection of companies' balance sheet futures*.................

My questions for a fellow avid reader: 

- At what heat and humidity does Covid-19's spread slow?
- By what percentage does this heat and humidity slow Covid-19's spread?
- With those reduced transmission amounts in effect, why are we still seeing community spread in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam this week, when all three countries were above 90F? 
- What factors will be different in 90F NYC and Chicago than Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam?
- The virus spreads especially well among the homeless and the imprisoned, will America's vulnerable population aid spread during the reduced transmission rates?

I look forward to you answers.

I will warn you before you give them though, to answer some of them? You'd have to use a projected, not a confirmed, disease model.

Are you suggesting the spread of the virus is equal in both hot and cold climates? Can you point me to a country that has a hot climate that has had a similar infection rate (per capita) as Iran, Italy, China, South Korea, Spain? All have mild/cool/cold temperature ranges throughout the day.  Just give me one hot climate country that is on a par with the spread rate of any of these countries.  

ANYWAY, let's look at your source:-

> The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment did not have major community outbreaks of SARS.

How does this counterargue that hotter climates appear to slow the spread of Covid-19? It is saying the same thing.  Hong Kong has rather cool temperatures in later winter/spring - easily within the bounds of a coronavirus to thrive.  

> We're at over 30,000+ confirmed cases in the last 24 hours alone. So, this seems to be just a little bit more infectious, wouldn't you say?

I never said it wasn't. The vast majority of those infections are taking place in cool/cold climates.

> There's further findings within that say that AC weather means this shit will spread like crazy. Someone coughs or develops the rare sneeze and gets that right into that cool, wet stream OH BABY, you've got a stew going. 

What is ""AC weather""? You mean air-conditioning, right? I refer you again to what is happening in reality - show me a country with a hot climate that is having a per-capita equivilant spread rate to colder countries.  Go here :- https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ - sort by ""total cases per 1M"" descending.  All cold climate countries in the top 20.  Bahrain is the first on the list I would classify as ""warm/hot"" and most of its cases were imported from Iran, as is the case with Qatar (next on the list).  

> With those reduced transmission amounts in effect, why are we still seeing community spread in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam this week, when all three countries were above 90F? 

These countries have way way way lower spread rates that colder climate countries.  You only back up my points with everything you say.  They have increased testing - you need to use some logic sometimes.  More testing = more positives found.  This virus has a huge long-tail of carriers who have very mild symptoms.  You test these or you don't test these - whatever you choose to do, you get different results (I live in Thailand by the way, and I have seen the effect of increased testing - two 7-11s near me have closed because a positive case was found nearby, people in the area have been tested because of this).  

I'm not even sure what your point is here - you didn't even read my sources (that much is obvious), yet I read yours - which actually backs up my points.

Your other questions are irrelvant to this discussion about climate's effect on the virus.",6

The study shows how hot and hot wet temperature has to be to counteract spread. Which is why you think: 

> Your other questions are irrelvant to this discussion about climate's effect on the virus.

When in fact, the studies done on betacoronaviruses show that even 38C+ and high levels of humidity only slightly reduce spread.

The link I sent you also showed that even though that does reduce it on aerosol, it doesn't stop it from living on plastic (and nCov-SARS-2 seems to live on surfaces longer than SARS). 

> What is ""AC weather""? You mean air-conditioning, right? I refer you again to what is happening in reality - show me a country with a hot climate that is having a per-capita equivilant spread rate to colder countries. 

Sure, you're in Vietnam. You have a higher spread rate than several European Countries based on that metric, [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing).

3/20/2020 7:13,"You borrow a stock from your broker and sell it now. In X time, you rebuy the stock, hopefully at a low price, and give it back to your broker, thus making a profit.

Shorting is not an easy thing to do. For one, many brokers won't let you borrow the stock unless you have a large cash balance with them and/or you can convince them you know what you're doing. Reason being, if the price goes up, you can lose a lot of money quickly, and brokers want to make sure you'll be able to give them that stock back

Secondly, shorting costs money. Borrowing that initial stock is still a ""loan"" from your broker that you'll need to pay interest on. You're just hoping that the stock goes down more than the interest on that loan

If you wanted to try shorting, you'll need to try to get a ""margin"" account from your broker (margin = ability to loan money from your broker), though again, there is an approval process via the broker",3

3/20/2020 7:17,"Adding to this, it only works in your favor if the stock goes down. If it goes up, and the owner wants to sell, you get â€œcalledâ€ and have to buy back the stock at the higher price, ultimately losing you money. Theoretically if the stock went up forever, youâ€™d lose an unlimited amount of money. An example in recent history is TSLA a few months ago, which had tons of short positions on it. They released good earnings and their stock shot up from the hype. Well, people that had lended shares to shorters wanted to cash out, and a lot of shorts had to be covered by buying the stocks back at the higher price. Since there was so much volume of buying back shares, there was a rapid increase in stock price known as a short squeeze. This caused a loop effect where that rapid increase caused more shorts to be bought back, price goes up, shorts bought back, etc. Everyone that shorted TSLA in that timeframe lost money. (They might be profiting now though)

So you see, shorting is a very risky strategy and I would never recommend it to anyone. Institutional investors can do it because they have plenty of capital in case things go wrong. If you want to profit off a downturn in the market, look into put options instead.",29

I recognize the margins restaurants, bars, hotels, airlines and other industries run on. But the demand for these industries will bounce back quickly once restrictions are lifted.

1.  Volatility is high, so you're going to pay a handsome fee if you're doing it with options.  

2.  The market is already down 25% or so, and in a fairly non-discriminate manner.  

Now, if you think that we're entering a 5 year depression then sure betting that it will go down more will pay off over the long term.  However, if at some point politicians just toss their hands up in the air and just re-open everything and let 1% of the population die or whatever, then you're going to be losing a ton of cash betting against the economy.  If it is shut down for a quarter or two and then starts a gradual recovery you're probably going to break even at best as we're already at 2017 prices, which means the market is basically pricing in being about 3-4 years behind in growth.

Now, I bet there are lots of individual stocks that you could profitably take positions on that are either long or short.  There are probably companies making essential products that don't have supply chain issues that were just sold down with the index.

> Funny how medical experts and economists disagree.

IMO the medical experts are guilty of hubris here, and the economists are just going off of them.  

I think the disease will spread MUCH more quickly than is being predicted, which means a higher death toll, but also a lower economic impact.  

Just read around Reddit, which obviously has a younger demographic.  A substantial portion of the younger population doesn't think this is a big deal, and will probably just go about their lives as normally as possible.  Ok, the bar is closed, so let's all go have a party at somebody's house.  They're going to spread this disease despite all measures to contain it.

And then everybody will be dead or immune, and the disease will disappear for the most part.  Oh, it will be around in the same sense that the flu is around, and probably about as deadly at that point.

Maybe in the meantime they develop treatments like chloroquine and that could save some lives.  But to the degree that the disease becomes manageable that is also going to contribute to an earlier return to normal.

So, whether due to a ""cure"" or due to a massive pile of bodies in the streets, I don't see this lasting more than about two months.

Don't get me wrong-  there will be lasting economic damage from two months, but not the sort of depression-level issues people seem to be talking about.  

And if it does last for a longer duration the economy will start to reorganize and create new jobs around managing the crisis.  That would be much slower...",-1

On March 12, the firmâ€™s chief economist and chief medical officer held a call for clients, during which they conveyed information on the economic and market impact of COVID-19. During the call, various statistics on the pandemic were cited and attributed to legitimate sources including governments and were not necessarily presented as a Goldman Sachs view.

There are some suggestions floating around (cold weather tends to see more people inside on average,  leading to more close contact leading to more exposure) but nothing definitive yet.  It's a hard metric to measure I'm sure.

For example, if I'm holding a bond that was issued to pay for a toll road, if no one is taking the road (fewer commuters) there's basically no way in hell that the local municipality that issued the bond can keep up payments.

In cases this these, I'm fine with restructuring the payments etc and ""rehabbing"" them once this stuff has blown over.  But I can't probably drive these decisions as a ETF holder (I don't even know who can).  Secondly, a ton of retirement funds depend on these payments to distribute income to pensioners, so they'll probably be fleeing to Fed bonds and dumping the corps and munis so I suspect there's more pain ahead.

She told me that liquidity in the credit market is completely gone. Corporate debt and muni bond markets are in a rough way.

Without getting too complex, bond funds need to transact rather frequently to maintain proper exposure. They have to replace maturing bonds with new bonds, manage portfolio duration, etc. That process has become painfully expensive because liquidity is gone and spreads are super wide - the funds themselves are taking huge losses as a result.

3/20/2020 11:24,"Each state has a trust fund that is paid into by employers and a balance is maintained to track how much credit each employer has against that fund.  The more people they lay off the higher their unemployment tax becomes to replenish their share of the unemployment trust fund, it also serves as a soft incentive to keep people employed since laying off = higher tax rate.  The unemployment tax rate is separate from other state corporate tax rates and can float depending on how much in benefits they pay out, fund going down, law changes, etc.  Generally it is a pretty popular and bipartisan program so its rarely fucked with.  Should that fund run out the state can take a loan from the federal government to cover a shortfall.  As of the end of 2019 the fund for the state of WA was about 4.86 billion for example.

You can look up each state's approximate balance here.  Pick the state name from the drop down, not sure what the other entries are for.  The number at the bottom is their current balance.

3/20/2020 11:53,"TL;DR of this very interesting article:

>The reason is simple: a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks"" like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didnâ€™t have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.


>So, yes, Virginia, you can eliminate nonsytematic portfolio risk, as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory, with a relatively few stocks. Itâ€™s just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. **Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.**


Basically, by picking specific stocks you have a chance (he quantifies 1/6 chance if picking from SPX) to pick a ""winner"" stock that will shoot up and beat the market, but by that logic you also have a 5/6 chance of picking something besides those winning stocks and end up lagging the market's returns.",13

How are you going to accurately predict unknowns :

\--- the percentage of the population that follows the rules?

\--- which untested and infected people make up the population?

\--- has the viral strain remained constant in aggressiveness throughout the entire population?  Has it mutated in any way in certain parts of the world?

\--- What percentage of companies were prepared for this?  Before you say none, then consider that there are varying degrees of people able to work from home.   What are the stats? 

\--- What is the GS model based on and what are the parameters?  What's the standard deviations?

It's hard to say. These losses are being caused in equal parts by transaction ""friction"" increasing and valuation of the bonds themselves decreasing.

Best advice I can give - assuming the fund manager is well capitalized, it's likely the funds will recover *at some point.* However, that could be weeks, months, or even years away.

If liquidity stress continues there could be further forced selling and more losses. In the worst case scenario its like that the funds will institute a redemption gate, preventing you from selling and getting cash.

The Fed has taken some drastic measures to combat the problem and (unfortunately) the market reaction so far seems to lack conviction in their actions. 

If you absolutely need access to the cash now or in the near future, the safest thing is to sell. If you don't, waiting is an option. It's something that should be watched closely however.",5

I'd say 300k is probably closer to a realistic ""best case"" scenario when this is all over.  Remember the regular flu is [killing upwards of 60k](https://www.health.com/condition/cold-flu-sinus/how-many-people-die-of-the-flu-every-year) in the US each year regularly, and we have standardized treatment and vaccinations for that.",30

No, as I stated earlier this is the fatal assumption. No bund fund buys a whole portfolio on day 1 and just sits on it until maturity.

They're buying different issues with different maturities constantly, managing portfolio duration (weighted average duration of all the individual bonds), etc.

Individual bonds guarantee principal repayment at maturity but bond funds do not provide any such guarantee. The bond funds are (in 99.9% of cases) perpetual vehicles without set maturity dates, which necessitates transactions.

Municipal bonds are popular among high-income investors, since the interest is exempt from federal taxes, in many cases including the AMT. Repurchasing munis will drive up the price, with the bulk of the benefits going to those who don't really need the bailout. States will get a marginally lower interest rate for new bond issues as a side effect, but the interest rates are already so low that it's not going to be a huge difference and any benefit to the states isn't going to be felt for at least several years (when states have marginally lower interest payments).",34

If a cure is discovered then there is no reason to shut everything down - now it is back to being a bad flu at worst and we don't shut down for that.

If shelter in place fails then within two months everybody has already been exposed, and there is no reason to shut anything down.  Plus out of work waiters and bartenders can get a side job digging graves.

I really don't see this dragging out as long as some think it will.  It just assumes that people will actually listen to epidemiologists and that politicians will spend vast fortunes trying to keep everything going with regular markets shut down.",7

3/20/2020 16:06,"Could you elaborate on where you read about the dutch/bolivian model? I came to a similar conclusion but wasn't aware there was a model name for it.

Since we are unlikely to have a vaccine for 12-18 months, if we continue our current society wide quarantine, the entire economy would collapse, starting with every hotel/travel related company going bankrupt. My guess is this would cause more societal disruption/long term deaths than having no quarantine.

If we have no quarantine, we could expect death rates in the range of 4-5% due to overload of hospitals. 

The only logical path seems to be quarantine only the highest risk group (20-30% of population) and practice staggered social distancing of the rest of population over 12+ months to decrease hospital overload. The highest risk group tends to be the oldest, least likely to be a key contributing part of the economy, and most likely to have the greatest healthcare usage if they contract the virus. 

Based on data from the London Imperial study, it shows a 35 year old having a 0.16% chance of needing critical care, while a 65 year old would have a 4.5% chance of needing critical care. This would indicate a population of 65 year olds that contract the virus would need 28X more healthcare resources than a population of 35 year olds that contract the virus.",6

This isn't even close to true. The rate is much higher than this if we are talking only people that were in a hospital. Not everybody that is tested positive has and can go to a hospital, mild cases are just in self isolation. Even if you are trying to say that the 2% is just people that have been tested you are still wrong, that would be 4%, despite most of the detected cases still going on.

Deadlier strains generally don't spread as much as mild strains, because those that get the more severe strain end up in isolation at home or in a hospital. WW1 was different - troops leaving England by boat to other parts of the world (Europe, US) were carrying the deadlier strain, and when infected / sick troops began arriving at various ports the virus exploded. It was basically the perfect conduit for mass spread.

Also, govenments at the time were hesitant to commit to mass quarantine (it happened a bit, but not nearly on the scale needed), and the press in most countries really did a poor job informing the public of what was happening. 

This is actually where the ""Spanish Flu"" name comes from. Spain was one of the few neutral countries in Europe, and one of the only countries around where the press wasn't censored from reporting on the virus for fears of its affect on morale. Spain essentially became one of the few countries even reporting on it.

You can read more details about the name origin here: 

Origin of the name: https://www.history.com/news/why-was-it-called-the-spanish-flu

Summary of why the deadlier strain proliferated so quickly: https://www.history.com/news/spanish-flu-second-wave-resurgence

None of this applies to the current state of the world even remotely.Same applies to treatment. Huge numbers of deaths from the Spanish Flu were due to secondary complications that we can treat today. Remember, antibiotics weren't even around till the late 1920s, so bacterial infections / pneumonia during 1918 would have been a death sentence for most.

Sort of, but not yet in the formal literature.

Intensivists in Italy have been warning their overseas colleagues about ICU admissions with profound and near untreatable hypoxia. These intensivists are describing multi modal impact with regards to age, and based on these warning letters it looks like the second worst mode is likely to be somewhere in the 40â€™s for critical care. I am expecting when the data is properly published to see a multimodal dataset for morbidity because of this. Still, actual mortality appears to be age related and linear. 

Profound and prolonged hypoxia causes high disease burden as so many organs are sensitive to oxygen changes. There is likely to be a lot of people with multi organ failures, especially renal failure, hypoxic brain injuries, and etc. These arenâ€™t documented in covid literature, but hypoxia has the same complications no matter what is causing it. In fact covid related multi-organ failures should be worse because many are documented to be having disorders of inflammation where cytokines are messaging neutrophils to kill too many healthy cells, and memory T to induce apoptosis more aggressively. This is why some people have been on treatment to suppress their immune response rather than strengthen it, because that can severely damage or kill you as well. 

Some professors from the University of Milan have released a formal report showing 12% critical cases of total diagnosed (that means just over 1 in 10 being in a coma, on a ventilator, and nursed in the department of critical care).

3/20/2020 17:03,">The first confirmed Chinese case occurred on November 17th. The WHO was not informed until December 31st.. Nov 17 -> Jan 23rd is well over 2 months.

You didn't read your own source eh? Nov 17th is the likely date the virus made the leap from animal to human. We, as a world, didn't even know that there was a new human coronavirus strain until [""December 26 -- Shanghai PHC received a sample of a patient with unknown pneumonia from Wuhan CDC and Wuhan Central Hospital and started an investigation to the sample which was later confirmed to contain a new coronavirus.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_in_mainland_China#Mysterious_pneumonia_outbreak). So China informed the WHO that same week and within 4 weeks of learning of the virus' existence China implement a complete lockdown of the province. 

>If you still trust China's numbers after everything they've done in the last few years, you are nuts. 

They had 600 *confirmed* cases within 4 weeks of even learning the virus existed, I don't find that hard to believe seeing as they had to scale up a new type of test in that same timeframe. Sure they probably had much more *actual* cases but I honestly doubt they had more *confirmed* cases (just as I think the US has far more *actual* cases than the 16k *confirmed*. We also can see that China has disassembled the makeshift hospitals they erected in February which is pretty strong evidence that their current number of infections is decreasing.

Whether or not there is a huge upsurge once china ends the lockdown is a different discussion entirely. It could very well be that the quarantine slowed the virus but doesn't stop it from eventually infecting virtually everyone.",6

Thing is, without bonuses, income from driving isn't high enough to keep most drivers interested.  That means rides isn't sustainably profitable.
2. If Uber can't make a profit at their present size, they never will.  The have a plurality of the rideshare market in most markets, so it's no longer a startup that can ""grow into"" its share price--it's probably impossible to double gross revenue from rides, unless you get people to abandon private vehicles.
3. They can't magically turn up margins after they scale because *they've already scaled*. They can increase margins and reduce market share or reduce margins and increase market share, but they're long past the point of running at a loss to build the network effects.  
4. Uber's other bets aren't really panning out.  Scooters fizzled.  Eats is really just an arm of rides. Autonomous cars aren't happening (Uber uses LIDAR, which means no autonomous taxis in the rain)

They could, of course, cut 90% of the engineering staff and all the unprofitable projects, and try to become operationally efficient in the rides business.  But then it becomes extremely difficult to justify the current share price (which is mostly based on expectation of future growth).",2

most homes with be sold to make ends meet especially if those same people lost their employment

also, if the mass majority of the boomer population is hit and people actually do start dying in higher numbers then that will leave a huge market open for the younger generation

of course this all depends on how long the economy is halted and how many people actually pass away (unfortunately)

3/20/2020 17:56,"The reason that they are doing this is because the banks are going to be needed to lend money to people and businesses because there is going to be a shortage of income by both and they will need loans to make rent, food, expenditures, and other day to day necessities.

While banks normally do that, it has never been done on the scale that it will take place at in the coming months. Banks have the assets to satisfy these needs most likely but the problem is that they dont have the LIQUID assets needed to cover the problem.

The problem is that a good amount of the debt that they own to fund high yielding accounts and CDs and such cannot be moved right now because nobody in the secondary markets (stocks, bonds, commodities, etc) is willing to buy them because they are scared and are selling off everything to get out of the way of the stock market continually chunking down. This leaves the banks with their hands tied behind their backs and if they can't loan out money to people then the problem simply compounds on top of itself because businesses close and people go bankrupt.

So this is where the Fed steps in and purchases these items off of the banks giving them much needed cash on hand to supply these loans. They come in, purchase the assets off the banks, hang onto them for a bit until this all fixes itself, and then they sell the same exact assets back to the banks and charge them a little bit of interest on the money.

As of right now, it is HIGHLY unlikely that any of this repo cash is going into the stock market. If banks get caught fucking around in situations like this with the Fed they can really lose a LOT more than they have to gain.

Short term, it devalues the dollar against other currencies because we are simply flushing the market with cash.

Longer term, it shouldn't mean much because once the Fed gets the money back they can just destroy it.",38

And what the age ranges for each death will be.

Beyond the deaths itself there might be depression and loss in productivity.

I'll also note even if the losses are mostly extremely old, that can have an effect.

Social morale might fall for many people, which can have socio-economic effects on morale as well. Many elder friends and family are trusted to be free daycare services, which might be a net cost or benefit to different economic sectors if parents need to find alternate daycare services or different jobs.

Work from home, remote work and automation might be more popular for some industries, along with flex time productivity metrics, meeting perhaps in person once a week or a daily web chat meeting time to discuss plans and milestones for the day/week.

In contrast, the US has not implemented any mandatory quarantines.

3/20/2020 20:20,"There were lots of great depression comparisons in 2008 too. They didn't envision things like TARP or an 800 billion stimulus package or QE etc etc.

Without that every bank would have failed and the predictions would have been accurate.

The government has even more latitude this time because there isn't much ""moral hazard"" to worry about here. The spectacle of giving trillions to bankers who caused the crisis was fraught with political risks. Not so this time. The Fed will keep adding trillions upon trillions without end. I expect the congress to throw 100s upon 100s of billions at the problem in a bipartisan way.

There is also just a lot the governments at all levels can do when facing an externally imposed threat and thats already happening (stuff like freezing evictions via edict which requires a state of emergency and political will). The more forward looking governors know the political cover is coming in the form of stacs of dead bodies. If anything, the risk on them is doing too little.

None of this is at all like the great depression which was characterized by DEEP divides on how to handle it and a lot of paralysis for a long time until WWII (an externally imposed threat and all the political cover they ever needed). Trump calling this a war is...dare I say it...smart and kinda even accurate. He will look more and more right once people start to die...and they will, in pretty large numbers sadly.

I'd never underestimate how the politics of a thing really matters, a lot. And America can recover very very fast if the whole political system is basically pulling in the same direction. You'd normally only see that in a major war but it may also apply to pandemics. I think it will, particularly as this gets to its peak.",24

The ability to stay at a hotel right now is not in a ""free market"" situation without facing a lot of social shaming.  We are being told literally to shelter-in-place, or we'll be causing the death of millions.

Compare that to 9/11, where people were free to use hotels, but the desire was 25% less according to Sorenson.  That was a free market choice, to not use hotels.

Thus, there is a valid thesis for hotels to quickly recover.  They will probably take a longer term hit as sentiment to travel stays low, but not 75-90% less as is the case now.  The current valuation doesn't reflect the strength of their business, imho.

Not necessarily disagreeing with you, but in '08 there was still a functioning economy even if it was depressed and there were liquidity issues.  We're looking at some industries going months with 0 revenue.  Localities will go weeks with near 0 sales tax.  There's a massive surge in unemployed so no payroll/income taxes.  No tickets, no permits, etc.  

Then there's the expense side: surge in unemployment claims, emergency measures of setting up public testing facilities, scrambling to increase hospital capacity, etc.

So governments are going to be squeezed very hard from both sides without federal support.

I even think hospitals and insurance companies are going to need and maybe get a bailout.  The hospitals will get bailed out by the states/municipal governments because I don't see the feds moving quick enough to handle so many small entities.",3

I may be wrong and stocks may only have been sold when there were buyers but again, they were bought and sold all through the 1930s and 40s until the 1929 height reached again, with money made in a general upward market.

My sense is the vector analysis that the most garbage AI can do is still probably an order of magnitude better than what we had available in 2008.

3/20/2020 23:27,"It shows you and the people upvoting you are not serious people. 

 No one outside of emerging infectious disease epidemiologists were even paying attention to this in early *January* let alone December.  You can check the CDC bulletins, theyâ€™re all archived.  Since China was covering it up no one really had any idea of the scope.

Edit: 

[The WHO relayed on Jan 14 that China knew of no human-to-human transmission](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152), but [China knew such transmission had been ongoing for weeks](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back)

[This is what the CDC was saying Jan 8](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00424.asp)

>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is closely monitoring a reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology (PUE) with possible epidemiologic links to a large wholesale fish and live animal market in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. An outbreak investigation by local officials is ongoing in China; the World Health Organization (WHO) is the lead international public health agency. Currently, there are no known U.S. cases nor have cases been reported in countries other than China. CDC has established an Incident Management Structure to optimize domestic and international coordination if additional public health actions are required.

>Background

>According to a report from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, as of January 5, 2020, the national authorities in China have reported 59 patients with PUE to WHO. The patients had symptom onset dates from December 12 through December 29, 2019. Patients involved in the cluster reportedly have had fever, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. Of the 59 cases, seven are critically ill, and the remaining patients are in stable condition. No deaths have been reported and no health care providers have been reported to be ill. **The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not reported human-to-human transmission.**

>Reports indicate that some of the patients were vendors at the Wuhan South China Seafood City (South China Seafood Wholesale Market) where, in addition to seafood, chickens, bats, marmots, and other wild animals are sold, suggesting a possible zoonotic origin to the outbreak. The market has been closed for cleaning and disinfection. 

>CDC has issued a level 1 travel notice (â€œpractice usual precautionsâ€) for this destination. (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/pneumonia-china). On January 5, 2020, WHO posted an update on this situation, including an early risk assessment, which is available at: https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/external icon.

>Recommendations for Health Care Providers

>1. Providers should consider pneumonia related to the cluster for patients with severe respiratory symptoms who traveled to Wuhan since December 1, 2019 and had onset of illness within two weeks of returning, and who do not have another known diagnosis that would explain their illness. Providers should notify infection control personnel and local and state health departments immediately if any patients meet these criteria. State health departments should notify CDC after identifying a case under investigation by calling CDCâ€™s Emergency Operations Center at (770) 488-7100.

>2. Multiple respiratory tract specimens should be collected from persons with infections suspected to be associated with this cluster, including nasopharyngeal, nasal, and throat swabs. Patients with severe respiratory disease also should have lower respiratory tract specimens collected, if possible. Consider saving urine, stool, serum, and respiratory pathology specimens if available.

>3. Although the etiology and transmissibility have yet to be determined, and to date, no human-to-human transmission has been reported and no health care providers have been reported ill, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to symptomatic patients with a history of travel to Wuhan City. Such patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed. Personnel entering the room to evaluate the patient should use contact precautions and wear an N95 disposable facepiece respirator. For patients admitted for inpatient care, contact and airborne isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, are recommended until further information becomes available. For additional information see: https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html.

To suggest that the President should have acted that dramatically in *December* before the CDC issued its first advisory on it is absurd.",37

The financial crisis of 2007â€“08, also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008 financial crisis, was a severe worldwide economic crisis considered by many economists to have been the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, to which it is often compared.The crisis began in 2007 with a depreciation in the subprime mortgage market in the United States, and it developed into an international banking crisis with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. Excessive risk-taking by banks such as Lehman Brothers helped to magnify the financial impact globally. Massive bail-outs of financial institutions and other palliative monetary and fiscal policies were employed to prevent a possible collapse of the world financial system. The crisis was nonetheless followed by a global economic downturn, the Great Recession.

They have factories in Asia which actually seems to have the best handle on this outbreak despite being the epicenter. And by virtue of being tech companies they should be fairly well skilled in remote work and flexible work capabilities. They also have the most cash on hand to deploy to buy out others at low prices, buy up their own shares, or pick up good employees when no one else is hiring. 

Honestly I donâ€™t know how someone could think tech would be impacted so heavily. Out of MSFT AMZN GOOGL and AAPL I would say AAPL will be most heavily affected, but even then they are having to limit online bulk orders not because of lack of supply, but actually because of excess demand due to potential price gouging as well as remote schooling iPads.

Repo Explained:

If I want to buy 1mm of a treasury bond, but I want to get leverage on it (it can actually be any htype of bond), I will buy that bond from, say, JP Morgan.  And JP Morgan will say ""I can finance that position for you, and I will charge you a 3% haircut and you will pay me 0.25%.""

the haircut is basically your equity in that trade.

So assume that the bond pays 1% interest.  In this scenario I would pay JP Morgan 30k (1mm bonds \* 3% haircut), and I will net 0.75% of interest (1% coupon - 0.25% interest charge).  So, on this trade I will receive:

Annualized you recieve:  $7,500 on a $30,000 investment.  Sounds awesome, right?  However two things happen that screws up the situation.

Many of these are done overnight.  So, when markets get volatile a couple of things can cause big problems.  The bank will be reducing risk, because markets are volatile and they want more capital.  So, the next day when you go to finance that bond, JPM says ""I need a 10% haircut"".  So you need to post an additional $70,000, or JP Morgan seizes the collateral ""blows you out"" and sells the bond to get their money back.

Or, the value of the bond goes down 10%, and basically the same thing happens.  They say ""I gave you this loan based on 1mm of collateral.  Now I only have 90k of collateral"" So you have to post 10k or you get blown out.

Now when the markets really are going crazy, maybe they increase the haircut to 10% AND the price of the bond goes down 10%.  You see how this gets to be a death spiral.  JPM (and all other banks) are seizing collateral and selling it into an already stressed market,  it causes prices to fall and fall quickly.

When the fed steps in they become the lender instead of JPM.

Its a bit more complicated, but that is the essence of the transaction.",2

Additionally there are several sectors that are hiring people (healthcare, food, tech/web services, manufacturing for key products, the USA census). I believe that a hard clamp down for a few weeks with gradual lifting of restrictions paired with a $1 trillion dollar stimulus package will be able to smooth over this non economic temporary crisis. People can believe differently, but if you compare this to any of the past plagues/pandemics this one is a voluntary cakewalk.

There still could be a recession for a couple quarters, but I donâ€™t see this going longer than a year in any possible scenario given that most people would have gotten the disease by then or there would be a vaccine.

Also while I was browsing Reddit I came across this link (below) as another example regarding Apple actually having surprisingly high demand for iPads. I donâ€™t know what other products youâ€™re referring to since I donâ€™t see why people would give up Amazon Google or Microsoft web services/cloud. Iâ€™m pretty sure people will keep buying off amazon given the orders not to travel unnecessarily. Iâ€™m pretty sure people will still use google. Apple and Google still have their app stores.

Then the question becomes. How large has the influence of the government actions been on the economy. How much debt has been taken. How hard it is to get back to ""business as normal.""

Some countries will be positioned to bounce back faster than others. Some businesses will suffer more than others. Grocers etc are in a ""business as normal"" mode right now.

3/21/2020 1:22,"The market hates uncertainty.

But the market is also irrational, and stock quotes are just the price tag.

So, we might be much deeper than what the real value of most companies are.

However, the real value of some of these companies could disappear over night. The crisis is about to hit the US, and it's not yet slowing down in Europe. 

Marginal value of companies is probably lower than they should be. Real world value probably hasn't changed, but could change dramatically. 

Let's take TSLA for example. Last time I checked, the book value of the company was $30 per stock. It was trading at $200. Now, it has gone up to the skies and came back down again. I very much doubt the actual value of the company has shifted, at all, during that time.

Now, let's compare that to the economy as a whole. We've operated for a long time in a world where stock prices do not match to the economy. Some trends say it has been quite ridiculous in the US. So, the stock market could probably already go to half its value, and it might not be terribly under of what the economy itself would value those companies at. Still, the actual value of the economy might not have moved. Maybe in the short term, the economy has grown due to panic and increased spending.

However, this only relates to price. Price is important, but I think the third factor in buying a stock is always most important. That factor is sustainability. It extrapolates during a crisis, but you can measure it and track it out of crisis as well. 

If you honestly looked at the trends of airline companies and air traffic in general, or how some of these airline companies have wasted billions in either stock repurchases, or doomed projects that didn't do anything, but drain their wallets. Even before the crisis, be honest, did you think they would be sustainable?

Now, back to the economy, and the US in general. The US has been in a trade war over multiple issues and with many of its largest partners. The US has cut taxes while income disparity has been growing. The US maintains a high productivity and low unemployment, but the workers do not earn a livable wage. While the stock market has soared, there has been worsening living conditions and decreasing wealth for a record amount of people. Not to mention the rate cutting, increasing both governmental and household debt levels.

Ask yourself, before the crisis, did you really think that was sustainable? 

My view on this is that it will showcase the mistakes made before COVID-19 ever evolved to be contagious. Now, we will only really see what level of damage that does to the economy and humankind eventually, but when you look at the magnitude and multitude of idiotic decisions, your outlook shouldn't be very hopeful. 

However, for a smart investor, this doesn't change anything. First you invest in yourself. So spend this time prioritizing your health, saving money, educating, etc. Secondly you create a base to work off from. Figure out how to keep an income if you can't leave your house for 14 days. Figure out if you still need to do some yard work or buy supplies.

Thirdly, and lastly, you buy and you hold. If you keep in mind the three factors, which are price to book value, price to earning, and sustainability, this is probably the best time to buy. You should always be doing much more research than buying. This is the perfect time to do the research. 

Let's end this with a thought exercise. Assume everything goes to shit. It's worse then WW2. Economy basically crashes. Which companies will still be operational? Which companies are essential? Which companies could not be happier with a complete economic destruction that COVID-19 will bring? 

Personally, I think just due to drop in oil price, most logistics companies saw their profit margins increase vastly. I'm certain most places will actually have more economical activity in terms of spending and consuming, if we just consider food, and other useful stuff. Now, there might be massive differences between logistics sectors and companies, but that's just my thoughts.

Invest in yourself, build a base, and buy and hold.

Someone else advised stop making contributions and save... that I have been doing. I guess that means I'm thinking somewhat rationally. I really wish I dumped into cash reserves weeks ago. Sigh, I know. That's the past. Also good to know that the funds I chose could have been worse.

But, I like to be ""home"" when things get crazy.

This  buy and hold line of BS is sold by brokerages because they want to keep  balances there, and lend out securities to make money.

Ask  Morgan Stanley if they are ""buy and hold"" when the stock market falls  10pct in a day.  No, they reduce risk so they can think clearly.

The smartest person I ever worked with (portfolio manager at a HF) said ""if you are ever nervous to open your daily P&L and see  how a position is performing, sell that position"".  The reasoning being,  if you are nervous to see it, you will stop looking at it.  You stop  looking at it then you start taking serious losses

if you are in it for the long hall...what does it matter if  you sit on the sidelines for 6 months, and get back in.  

If you have this level of anxiety I would be out of the position, and go and enjoy some fresh air and think for a few days or even weeks, instead of being glued to the screen.

I am sure 100k will give you a good amount of breathing room if it takes you a while to find a job.

Apple has something like $120 billion in cash, and they can ride out the rough times, but imo they will get hit hard if there is a major recession.

In 2008 and 2009 they had revolutionary new products that people wanted despite the recession, but their new stuff does not has as much of a â€œmust haveâ€ element to it as the iPhone and iPad did when they were new. Still a great company, but they are now about evolution, not revolution.

What I would like to see Apple do is acquire Disney once it drops a bit more during this recession. (The parks are closed, movie theaters are closed - Disney will get rocked hard, and Apple easily has the cash to buy them.) 

Apple would the  own the top movie studio in the world, ABC, ESPN, the entire Disney backlist of movies, and they could use Disneyâ€™s experience and resources to help Apple make its own â€œmust haveâ€ movies, TV shows, etc to compete with Netflix.

That dividend, if you're in the accumulation phase, should be reinvested to buy more shares - you're getting BETTER return now - the shares are on sale.

Accounting for dividend reinvestment, markets have returned something like 9% in absolute terms for the last century - including the crash that led to the Great Depression, Black Monday 1987, the Dot.com bust, the 2008 GFC.

> > The reason is simple: a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks"" like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didnâ€™t have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.

Itâ€™s just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.

3/21/2020 8:04,"First let's focus on what's good.  

A stock buyback allows the company the flexibility to decide how to return value back to shareholders.   If the stock were undervalued it's easy to understand why this is a better move than simply issuing a dividend.  It's not taxable and dividends carry the baggage of expectation that they will continue.  Right now would be a great time for a buyback if the company is flush with cash.

Why it's looked upon negatively.  #1 is they're poorly timed and done when the stock is already inflated.  People were saying  that  ""valuation is dead"" while companies were issuing buybacks.  So many investors were looking at stories versus fundamentals to drive stock prices, which means the whole point of improving the company was done at an inflated price when people cared the least.

There's also no financial health check that companies need to go though prior to issuing a buyback.  Case in point,  Gamestop, in trouble issued a huge buyback back in December.  If they can't think of anything better to do with cash than to buy gamestop stock then they should just resign.

But the real red flag for me as an investor is that it's a sign that management cannot think of any new avenues for growth.  The C Suite couldn't think of anything better to do with a large sum of money.  Not pay off debt, or acquire a business or increase R&D.  They just press an easy button.

Yes dividends are also money out of pocket but it's money in hand if you're not in drip and it's not subject to market volatility and they're predictable and the business can still accumulate wealth to drive growth around it.  Stock buybacks are wealth accumulated they don't know what to do with.",9

This is a giant crisis but a crisis with a foreseeable end.

The moment we have great therapies and the moment a vaccine comes out (next 12 months probably) the economic bottom will be reached.

Potentially however they might reopen the economy with the next 8-10 weeks simply because (and I hate to phrase it that way)  the opportunity costs of letting a few million old people with limited economic value die is a lot lower than the opportunity costs of causing global economic, social and political turmoil which will inevitably follow if this shout down continues.

I think the coronavirus stuff is overblown.  Most of the reactions I've seen implies a lack of understanding of viruses and statistics that should have been covered in highschool. It's been 2 months ish and I'm still seeing people asking rediculous questions that should've been cleared up 7 weeks ago.  WHO is reported raw data, they arent qualifying it in anyway.  Seems like fauchi is being a tad more liberal, but still very conservative,  as he should be.  There is some politics at play too.   The most realistic worst case scenario I've heard for the u.s. is 1 million deaths....I think 200k is more realistic as an absolute worst case scenerio.  Shitty...definitely.  I doubt it would change the next 5 year total mortality rate.  It mostly affects  the elderly.....  3 millionish die a year.....  apart from some anomalies, respiratory infects tend to knock out people who were already near their end.  

That being said, I think its spreading a lot faster than the average person realizes and there are people who have already got it and are still freaking out about potentially getting it.  Once the surge of numbers comes in, I think its going to quickly taper off.  People will interpret that however they want, but effectively its over.  People will also see joe from next door was confirmed to have it and only had a minor cold.  Panic subsides.   I also think once the unemployment numbers come in too....the government will realize how many businesses have no capacity to work from home.  They're also not realizing how many small businesses can't afford to give paid sick leave.  They wont have the stomach go keep it going.  I'm thinking a month from today is when most of this will settle down.

Once this COVID is over and stocks jump back, just see how SPCE will perform after their first succesful commercial flight. It will be however only inflated by the hype, just as TSLA, the company will be overpriced, so make sure you sell out after you have a reasonable return because I think it will fall back as SpaceX starts with its Starship things and other companies join in.

Other have mentioned this ITT and i agree with them. Moving my money into that fund immediately stopped the bleeding.

Thats just my â€œcurrentâ€ money. â€œfutureâ€œ money, iâ€˜ve chosen to put into the SP500 fund to buy whenever i get paid. Last couple of checks has gone to that and has lost money because the market is a bottomless pit right now but at least the bulk of the money is stable.

This virus has shut down large parts of the economy and I think that it will get worse before it gets better. A study by the Royal College of London, using epidemiology models, says that the virus cannot be contained by lockdowns and quarantines. It says that to *almost* stop it we would have to lock down completely for 2 months, relax and return to normal, and then repeat and repeat. If this is not done, the virus (absent a vaccine or treatement) will explode again.

The economies of the world cannot function normally under these conditions. Even 2 or so months into this emergency, many companies (especially airlines) face bankruptcy. There will be a wave of layoffs as ports shut down, airlines lay off pilots and stewards, etc. Goldmansachs predicted 20 percent unemployment. This is Great Depression stuff.

Plus the conditions will have a demoralizing impact on people. It's one thing to social distance for 14 days, when this turns into an endless house arrest people will start cracking.  Consumer spending will tank. Malls and commercial real estate will plummet in value. And so on.

I will know that it is time to buy back in when optimism returns, when there is a vaccine, or something else that brings this to an end. Then I think there will be a rally, as the world's economies come back to life.

I will not be the first back into a new bull market and will miss out on some profits, but I am also not going to ride the stock market all the way down to its lowest level.

The market could indeed still drop, but dropping 86% in today's environment just isn't realistic considering we have so many more macroeconomic tools to prevent widespread unemployment like what happened in 1929.

3/21/2020 9:32,"\>What happens if we find the disease is really as bad as Italy is saying it is? And what if next week New York hospitals run out of ICU beds?

The Italian report said [99%+ of the deaths had comorbidities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says). This just isn't killing healthy people. The numbers from Korea also suggest a lot of young people get it and have no or few symptoms; no people matching this description have been tested in the US, so our numbers are artificially low. This is a bad thing because it means the virus will spread more; but it's also good if young people can build up immunity and grant some herd immunity to the country. From the article:

\> The average age of those whoâ€™ve died from the virus in Italy is 79.5.

But yes, it can still overwhelm our medical system with those who need acute care whether they die or not. And unfortunately, because the average American is a selfish idiot, we're going to get overwhelmed unless martial law is declared - I took a bike ride yesterday and saw lots of people playing basketball in close quarters, hanging out in front of corner stores, etc. Being outside is fine, being in close contact with others in public is not. Too many people not taking this seriously. The testing will help though, really. It means people who aren't symptomatic or have minimal symptoms can get tested and quarantine. Positives tests will increase compliance. Antibody testing is also useful - because then some people can safely interact with others without fear of contracting or carrying the virus themselves.",2

1.	Coronavirus shut down China, and spread to other countries including the US. 
2.	Most people in US didnâ€™t even care about coronavirus bc Trump said itâ€™s a non issue for Americans
3.	US has the worst healthcare system and the most ignorant/selfish people. It was obvious the virus would spread the most in US.
4.	Stocks were inflated from years and years of stock buy backs
5.	Stocks were inflated from very lower interest rates, companies in lots of debt

If you couldnâ€™t predict this recession, then youâ€™re just another sheep blindly trusting in the mass population. Itâ€™s not as smart to keep DCAing in this climate than to just pull out and wait for the dust to settle.

When they stopped injecting money in the company, they took it public, so people like you and I could give money to Uber so it can function and operates while we both hope for the company to become profitable and be rewarded through dividends or an increase in company's share price.

Ultimately, the company was also funded with debt which are bank loans that are due in X years. and as long as the company can pay its interest it's fine.

Age 32, employed c100k, Â£350k mortgage at 3%. No other big assets or debts.

Sold my business in early Jan 20. Probably good timing, dodging the COVID bullet, which would have undoubtedly dragged things out more or possibly killed the deal altogether.

Exited with about 3mm and followed usual sidebar advice which left about 2.5mm for investments. Didn't need the money for 5+ years.

I was skeptical of the main equity index valuations..but on the other hand I generally buy into efficient market hypothesis, indexing, boglehead approach etc. So I lumped in, but with a pretty defensive portfolio:

40% Vanguard LS40

60% IG Global Corporate Bonds UK Hedged (60% US, 40% World)

Turns out this portfolio weathered the early storm quite well! Bonds were fairly uncorrelated until the market really took a dive. For the last week or so, credit risk of even investment grade has tanked the bond market. The hedged fund also turned out horribly because the pound has taken a 15% dive against USD, which would have mitigated some of the downside, I think. I don't quite understand if that is going to be a further drag on this fund over the coming months because of how the currency futures work (thanks for anyone who can explain impact).

I've lost around Â£375k in two months or -15%. In hindsight it may have been prudent to pay more attention to the global economy or average in over 6 months. My two business partners went 100% into stocks and are now down, like most others, around 30%. So, could be worse.

Plan is to switch the bond fund into stocks at some point over the next few weeks/months now valuations are more reasonable. **Should I switch the bonds to cash NOW or hope to recover something in the bonds over the next few months before doing that?** If the market settles down bonds could bounce back as credit risk abates. If not, there's gonna be a lot of bankruptcies. This fund basically has a lot of equity risk without the premium now.

Of course there  are massive improvements possible to make something like this even less disruptive, but overall some portion of people getting laid off, or getting paid sick leave, only to be rehired in a couple weeks (worst case couple months) after getting some help from government and banks deferring mortgages etc is not the end of the world. We were essentially at an all time low for unemployment in the USA so if it temporarily ticks up a couple % only to stabilize and fall within the next year or two that is not the end of the world.

3/21/2020 10:15,"Boeing has had around a 10% profit margin on around $100B revenue annually, about $10B/year profit, although it was down significantly (break even, no profit) since the 737 debacle.

Theyâ€™re asking for $60B in loans from the government.

Meaning even if they were as healthy and profitable as they were before the 737, they would need 6 years worth of profit saved in cash to survive the next 6 months.

Honestly itâ€™s easy to get upset at financial issues we donâ€™t really understand but in this case itâ€™s not so bad. We should bail out Boeing. We canâ€™t allow a 150,000 employee company that we depend on for military contracts to fold just because we donâ€™t like Wall St. I think people misunderstand the true cost of these bailouts and who benefits: itâ€™s not $60B free money, itâ€™s either a loan or the government purchasing part of the company. Boeingâ€™s market cap is $53B right now so the governments offer could simply be to nationalize it, to take over and buy the company. Then the government reaps all future profit, which if they get back to $10B/year could repay itself within 6 years.

I trust theyâ€™ll reach a good deal. The public outrage is misplaced.",19
3/21/2020 10:15,"> that's like fighting back against anyone who wants to be a professional athlete because most people fail at it.

I donâ€™t think this is a good analogy. The kid who wants to play in the NBA is still presumably going to school, studying, etc, can go do something else if he fails.

Trying to time the market with your portfolio has far more dire consequences because if you fuck it up and slash your returns, you likely wonâ€™t have enough to retire.. at least for most people (who by the way have less than a grand in savings... the average American does not have much to fall back on)...

Iâ€™m thinking maybe you just arenâ€™t aware of how bad the typical numbers are for market timers. Itâ€™s not like half of them so slightly worse than the market and half do slightly better. The vast majority actually significantly underperform the market and out of those who beat the market most donâ€™t do it by very much. 

Your statement about being right and wrong sometimes is what makes me think you donâ€™t know just how bad the odds are for a wannabe market timer. A lot of this is psychology I believe, with studies finding that people unironically buy high and sell low... they buy when things are good and sell when things are bad. However, you talk about â€œabilitiesâ€ and itâ€™s worth asking how many actively managed funds beat the market? Not very many, and not even fewer do it consistently. 

I donâ€™t disagree that itâ€™s possible to do it, and I also donâ€™t disagree that a smart investor who knows what theyâ€™re doing can adjust their portfolio holdings, maybe to try and reduce beta, maybe use options as a hedge understanding that ~1% is likely a sunk cost, etc.

I have some extra cash and have been hearing person after person talking about buying into stocks right now as many prices have plummeted.

Iâ€™m not looking to spend thousands, and Iâ€™m by no means looking for a get rich quick theme. Iâ€™m simply looking to see if buying in during these times could possibly set me up for a benefiting future.

In referring to the rules - i have a few thousand I can â€œplay withâ€. I am 24 years old, I hold a job as a Police Officer and have standard student Loan debts on top of the regular joe bills/rent. My goal is to increase savings for the future.

3/21/2020 10:17,"DCFs are good to find ""value"" but not price. After determining the price, a DCF is helpful to tell whether the value is trending up or down. I would never use a DCF alone to determine the price of a company's stock. It may work in very low growth, low risk industries (maybe like utilities?), but otherwise there are way too many assumptions that go into DCFs that make them a reliable indication of price. The only way to make reliable assumptions would be to have access to the company's management (or a ton of industry specific experience and knowledge, and time to do modeling) to get a better idea of projection risk, etc.

The best way to find price is with publicly traded comps and performing a comparable company analysis. The comps ideally are in the same industry, have similar margins, similar outlook, and a similar debt:equity profile. After finding your comps, you would compare a financial metric multiple of the comps to the subject company. For most companies you should use an EBITDA multiple. For certain tech companies with a lot of recurring revenue you could use a revenue multiple, for financial companies you could use a net income multiple, and then there are various industry specific multiples for oil & gas. For companies that are high growth you should use the next fiscal year estimate instead of last twelve month.

The comps are never going to be perfect matches, so this requires comparing what is different about the subject company vs the comps to determine if the multiple of the subject company should be higher than the median comp multiple. For example, if the margins are higher on your subject company (assuming all else equal), it's multiple should be higher. Or, if leverage is lower on the subject company, that also supports a higher multiple, etc.",3

I think that as the death toll climbs, unemployment reports come out in unprecedented form, more states go on lockdown, the market will tank more.

Plus, why should airline stocks rally right now? Even if they're debt-free and fully capitalized today, domestic flights are down 80%, international flights down even more than that.

I think right now is at least not a terrible starting point. Yes, the market *could* fall another 30%, but recovery to the current point will be relatively swift and it is not guaranteed that if you wait *and* the prices fall further, that you actually pull the trigger and get in at a better point.

Now we have employees that would be making near minimum wage doing the same job for another company making 30-40k+ a year.

One of the reasons it probably doesn't happen in more companies is because of greed and not just the greed of owners/share holders. When I first proposed this, one of our site managers lost her shit at the mere thought of a lowly bottom of the food chain employee getting a $1,000 bonus on their check. Even after I explained to her dumb ass that if that employee is getting a $1,000 bonus, that means they made the company close to $3,000-4,000. Which then increases our bonuses.

3/21/2020 11:29,"Ok.

First of all, I'm from Mexico. My money has been devaluated greatly. 1 month ago, one dollar was worth 19 pesos. Now, its 24 pesos.

So I've been saving pretty much for the last 7 years. I have a pretty good pay, so I have enough to buy myself a nice house right now, which is my goal with all of these savings. I had this money on a somewhat moderate portfolio, so I've obviously lost money recently, though not in a catastrophic fashion. I had most of the pesos in debt. What a had in stocks was mostly in the USA so I've both lost stocks plumetting and won some due to the rate exchange. All in all you could say that a) my money is the same in pesos and b) my money is worth less because the pesos are now worth a LOT less.

Im a little concerned that most of my money will be a lot less worthy in a year, so I'm planning in buying a house with what is 65% of my savings. I can keep living in my old small house after buying it, and since its a new house that im buying, there won't be many extra expenses. I think its a conservative approach because everything here in mexico is going to skyrocket in a couple of months in prices due to the value of the dollar. I could wait and maybe buy a house of people that go broke, but I think my approach is more conservative.

Imagine if you could get 4.30% right now on a 10 year US treasury. Of course equities are going to have lower multiples when you could get 4% on a treasury.

When Bear Sterns blew up you could get the 10 year at 3.5%

Notice how low the CAPE is in 1981? Sept 1981 the 10 year was paying 15.84%!

Bank savings accounts were paying over 10% at that time in 1981. People viewed equities as being dead at that time since why would anyone take a risk in the stock market when your bank account was paying 10% risk free with no volatility.

The problem though is it is not a linear function that you can just normalize the 10 year rate vs the CAPE to be able to compare apples to apples 1981/2001/2009 vs now. You do have to de-trend it in your head a little bit based on interest rates.

If we can recover from the Great Depression, which was an 85% drop from peak, we can get through this. There is even a decent chance this will not be as bad as the GFC, if our global containment efforts are sufficient. Keep in mind the GFC was the kind of perfect storm global financial meltdown that only happens once every few decades. Don't get me wrong; this could be that too if we end up having to stay isolated for prolonged periods. The whole goal here is to take drastic action now before even more drastic and prolonged action is needed later.

The people who consistently made out the best during the depression were the ones who had investment vehicles that could not be easily valued or sold. This is because they were forced to ride the rollercoaster down, then subsequently back up. Sure, people were able to achieve better with market timing. Yet, for every 20 who tried, 19 failed.

3/21/2020 12:40,"Volatility drag is the commonly listed boogieman of 3x etfs, but it's not their main issue during normal conditions. In fact, the consecutive green days seen in a low volatility bull market help drive the exponential growth seen by 3x etfs by the same principle working in reverse. By that I mean if there are 3 consecutive +1% days, a 3x bull etf will have 3 consecutive 3% days and your return would be more than 3x the return on the unleveraged index.

The obvious issue is bear markets. The increased volatility means that a 10% rally after a 10% drop on the unleveraged index would leave the unleveraged index at 99% of its value before these two days, but the 3x etf at 91% of its value. Volatility drag does become a big issue here. The large single day drops can wipe out a huge portion of these funds in one day. [Here is an article by seeking alpha that shows backtests of simulated 3x etfs since 1986.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4121068-best-3x-leveraged-etf) If you do want to hold these etfs as a portion of your portfolio long term, I'd consider a market timing strategy. [The strategy outlined here is what I use.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4226165-trading-strategy-beat-s-and-p-500-16-percentage-points-per-year-since-1928) It's very simple, sell when the index TECL is based on (IXTTR) closes below its 200 day moving average, and buy back in when it goes above its 200 day moving average.

Theres nothing wrong with using these etfs to juice your returns, although you are taking a risk and I would not allocate too much of your portfolio to one. If you do not fully understand what you are investing in, do not invest in it. We're about to see how actual 3x etfs perform through their first market crash, so see how TECL does over the coming months before putting money in.",19

Very new to investing, like VERY new. Just got interested amidst all the market crashes caused by Corona. 

I have 20k to potentially invest. 

With oil now in the low 20's, would it be a terrible strategy to invest 20k now, ride it out and cash out when oil returns to the 60 range? 

Seems like an easy forget about it and treble your money eventually situation...

What are the risks? 

Where am I being foolish? 

What am I not considering?

I'm not interested atm in short term trading. Just looking to invest in markets that almost certainly must make a comeback once this is all over? 

Is it rediculous to assume that oil will eventually return to the 60's in the next 2 years? 

Any advice much appreciated. And feel free to roast me on my amateurish naivety. Tough love it good, I just wanna learn.

Cheers guys!

Yeah so you're exactly that type of person this post is designed for. Glad you at least now understand what you're responding to. 

Just because something proceeded a market crash doesn't mean it was what contributed to causing. Financial markets are A LOT more complicated than that. 

If you just make a list of all the factors (besides the virus) that you think helped contributed to the crash (see https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fmf54g/crash_was_not_solely_due_to_covid_signs_of_a/ for instance) you're fooling yourself if you just automatically think they actually make a causal contribution. You need a lot more argument and evidence. 

Look up confirmation bias. For instance, if you just think that ""high prices in the FAANG stocks"" and ""the crazy bitcoin hype these past few years"" had to have contributed because (1) they were a unique event before the crash and (2) they are generally considered to be suspect / bad .... then that's a weak argument. 

You're over-attributing causes before you have sufficient evidence.",2

Our highest quality data, from South Korea and from quarantined cruise ships, show a mortality rate of .7-1.2% when proper medical care is provided. When proper medical care is not provided, we see something like Italy, where an overwhelmed medical infrastructure is unable to treat everyone and the mortality rate goes up. My wife estimates that the true mortality in Italy right now is at least 2% - and while Italy does have a higher population of elderly vulnerable people, that increase in mortality in the face of insufficient treatment is concerning because:


A lot of places aren't mitigating spread enough. The rule will be overwhelmed health systems.


Anyway, she estimates that in 18 months, unless we see a miracle in the healthcare situation here, the US will see at least 100,000 deaths of young and healthy people. 4 million total deaths in the US is not impossible.


The only way to stop this thing in its tracks is to do a China-style lockdown, globally, for at least 6 weeks. That won't happen, so it's not going away.


Here's the canary: if the hospitals in New York City aren't completely overwhelmed in 3 weeks, it may not be as bad as she's predicting.

3/21/2020 13:42,"This is such a broad question but I want to try and help.

I am no professional and people can only give advice.

First, you have to decide are you looking short term (sub 30 days), mid term (sub 2 years) or something extended beyond.

If you are looking for big gains, big risks, short term or mid term... options, spreads. If you donâ€™t understand these, I would highly recommend just donâ€™t. You could get lucky, but sometimes you just give money away and thatâ€™s not fun. Youâ€™ll see some people making 10k into 250k in a month but most of these people have a level of understand of this style of market and the market in general, and a lot of good fortune.

If you are looking for long term gains with a potential economic recovery, look towards companies that make things you use frequently... coffee, computers, tech companies, ketchup, snack foods, just think of anything people use all the time.

If you are looking for long term gains with what appears to be limited risk with the upside of an economic collapse or hedge.... gold and silver. Guns and ammo. Things like that. 

In my opinion, spend $2,500 on silver, $2,500 on gold, $3,500 in companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, Cola.

Take the other $1,500 and book two vacations when all this settles.",14

Take the top five mutual funds and look at what their top 10 holdings are.  Cross reference which of these companies are held by most or all of these funds, and buy those individual stocks.  This way, you should enjoy the same success as the best fund managers without having to pay their management expense ratio.

I would also add that one of the best fund managers I listen to stated that this crisis is giving us an ""unprecedented"" opportunity to grow a great deal of wealth.  Just be careful as to what you invest in and keep an eye on both the market and the company's fundamentals.

3/21/2020 14:33,"So far, I feel like a lot of the responses have been for very short-term, riskier investments strategies. Which, if that's what you're looking for, then great go with that. It was kind of difficult to understand whether you wanted short or long-term gains from your original post.

In light of this, I am just going to tell you my investing strategy since I may be in a similar position to you (21 years old, decent amount of cash on-hand to invest, just getting started, looking to maximize LONG TERM gains).

I would suggest first maxing out a Roth IRA (likely 6k/year). That way you get tax advantages later on compared to just using an online broker. For this account you can probably just use whatever target-date fund is recommended and be fine. Right now I am planning on putting the majority of my IRA into VTSAX. 

Also worth looking into is a company 401k. ESPECIALLY if your company will match a certain percent of contributions. If you do a traditional 401k, it allows you to contribute pre-tax money, taking away from your taxable income, and potentially saving you a good deal of money.

Then, after exhausting these options, you can go to an individual brokerage to invest the rest of the money you plan on investing. I recommend robinhood because it has 0 commission/fees. If you did want to experiment with shorter term investment strategies, or buying individual stocks, I would do that with this account. In my robinhood account i am still heavily invested in an S&P tracking ETF (~80%), but am also buying some individual stocks that I think are underpriced. 

Disclaimer: I am a new investor, this is just what I've learned the past few months. Please correct me if I'm wrong at any point.",10
3/21/2020 14:33,"Any reputable brokerage will ask you questions to see if you understand options because you can lose a lot. I would talk to them to understand the risks of buying options and they can break down everything you need to know and what you would need to get level 1 approval. It's basically gambling, imo, because all you're doing is speculating. You need to understand your risk tolerance and I would recommend using think or swim's paper money  (through TD Ameritrade) to see if it's something you want to do. Options can suck up all your time because you're constantly paying attention to the news and building charts to understand the market, especially in a volatile market that we're experiencing right now. But if you do do it, I would also recommend getting some good karma from your gains by donating to charity because the sad part of it is that if you're buying puts in a bear market, you are betting and cheering on the downfall of a company of which workers depend upon for their livelihoods. 

Let's say you don't like to gamble and it's too much work to buy options. Right now, stocks are basically on sale. Let's say you buy an 200 shares of an airline for $20/share... once the market rebounds, you might see 100% gains in a year.

>why someone who makes over 100k and hasnâ€™t lost their job deserve a 1k monthly check 

1. People who havenâ€™t lost their job will still see loss of income through loss of work time, cut pay, and increased logistical costs. 

2. Everyone will experience increased costs during the pandemic/downturn. These costs can range from childcare to credit card debt. 

3. Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck regardless of how much money they bring in a year. This is for a variety of reasons but can mostly be summarized as cost of living creep. 

4. 1k given to people does functionally more then 1k given to large business right now. 1k to big business will most likely put into a stockpile to be used during the slowdown. 1k to people has a much larger effect on the economy because that money is often spent multiple times over.

5. Lastly they are people and they deserve help and compassion in such a unpredictable time with widespread fear and lack of leadership. I know wacky idea. 

Iâ€™m not saying youâ€™re for bailing out wall street and against everyday people. Iâ€™m just saying itâ€™s funny that we donâ€™t question giving endless limitless loans to large corporations that clear hundreds of billions of dollars in profits and didnâ€™t think it was a good idea to set some aside in an emergency fund.

This crisis is NOT about the virus. It is about a wild overreaction by federal, state, and local governments in dealing with it, combined with general ineptitude. Rate cuts are not going to help a supply shock, and shutting down entire portions of the economy will lead to mass unemployment and cratering earnings.

US stocks have never looked worse than right now. They are still over-valued, while Washington and the Fed keeps throwing bombs at the economy. Now this could change, but I don't expect to make anything off securities for years, or maybe even until retirement. My state is losing 25,000 jobs per day.

I expect that the NYSE will be shut down completely by Thursday. None of this had to happen.

A vaccine will be crucial and we're at least 10 - 12 months away from initial testing results. If the virus mutates, it will complicate recovery. Everyone is hoping for a v recovery but prepare for an L shaped recovery. We will have starts and stops as the situation evolves. There will be both positive and negative surprises.

You can't control income but you can control costs for the most part. Focus on what makes you and your loved ones happy that doesn't cost a lot of money.  Honestly, we're way too materialistic.

Re-evaluate your skill set. If you're laid off, keep an open mind as to new industries and roles. Some of that savings may have to be used for retraining. You aren't alone when it comes to uncertainty. We're all in the same boat.

It looks like your portfolio is focused on ETFs so it's unlikely to go to zero. If your plan to retire is by age 60, your investments will likely recover by that time. Inflation will be the true enemy. When the economy settles and the employment situation stabilizes, start nibbling in the markets again but try not to dollar cost average down. Instead, invest in new viable opportunities.

I would suggest reading up on past oil crashes, what caused them, how they recovered, how long it took to recover, anything you can find really. Once you know all of that, ignore it because this is a completely new situation, and does not need to follow historical trends. Do extensive research into this specific crash, how companies are responding, why it happened, outlook reports FY20/21/22.

22 F, graduated 2019 December, currently a software engineer 

Goals :

Buy a luxury home one day, international trip once a year, retire early 

Current Stats :

Graduated debt free so no loans
Currently have about $22,000 in savings from internships, not invested in anything (Iâ€™ll get to why)
Every month after paying rent, bills, food, entertainment, charity, 401k contribution I have about : $3668 

Iâ€™ve read so much online on how to go about investing and everyone says mutual funds, some ppl say 401kâ€™s, Roth IRAâ€™s and Iâ€™m just thoroughly confused as to whatâ€™s best for me in context of my goals and financial situation. I just need some guidance on what to do with the money I have in my savings and what to do with the money I save every month thatâ€™s not going towards anything.

Also my 401k contribution is about $100 because my company has really bad match, itâ€™s capped at $900 annually thatâ€™s matched or else I would contribute more. Iâ€™m also confused as to whether I should contribute more anyway even though the match sucks or should I contribute towards a Roth IRA. 

My concern with 401k and Roth IRA is since I canâ€™t withdraw that money until I retire, what am I supposed to do if I want to buy a house or go on a trip and my money is tied up in these retirement accounts and I canâ€™t enjoy it while Iâ€™m young?

The chances of the market not recovering at all is very low, as drastic changes to our economy would have to take place, but there is still a chance, which should be considered.

The next part of your question is â€œhow longâ€. Well, in a similar vein, this is also unknown and many predictions have been made already.

3/21/2020 14:59,"The cape and the 10 year do diverge quite often though. And this is the time to make informed investment decisions. 

In '99 the 10 year yield was about 6%. The cape peaked during the dot com boom at 44, implying a 2.2% earnings yield (1/44). This was a time where treasuries had an objectively better risk-reward profile. 

Similarly, 2006 showed 5% treasury yields vs 3.7% earnings yield. Again,  treasuries looked like the better choice. 

This time around (pre pandemic) cape peaked at about 33, implying 3% earnings yield vs 3.06% treasury yield.

Cape isn't a timing strategy, but it can be useful in deciding allocation.

Since 2017, I had been slowly (very slowly) shifting out of stocks and into bonds based on the spread described above. The projected returns just weren't high enough for the added market risk.

3/21/2020 15:13,"Given the recent market drop, I managed to harvest quite a bit of capital losses. I understand the rules for deducting 3k max income per year, and that we need to apply capital losses against our capital gains of the same type first. However, assuming that I make no capital gains and that I simply use these losses to deduct 3k of my income every tax-year, carrying forward the left-over losses, Is there a limit to how many years I can carry losses forwards?

&#x200B;

I found two web pages: one which suggests that there is no limit on the number of years ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-loss-carryover.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-loss-carryover.asp)), and one which suggests that the limit is 8 ""assessment years"" ([https://cleartax.in/s/set-off-carry-forward-capital-losses](https://cleartax.in/s/set-off-carry-forward-capital-losses)).

This is false. Many jobs that have you work from home often come with reduced hours and pay. My partner went from payable 60-70 hour weeks to 45 hour weeks. This results in a lower income than excepted and planned. Again many jobs will see reduction in hours as well as temporarily freezing contractors. Letâ€™s say you are a construction worker clearing 100k a year. Suddenly what job site are you working on? Whereâ€™s your income stream? Sure you make 100k net every year but that doesnâ€™t help now that all your work sites arenâ€™t able to continue.

> And why is credit card debt increasing for these people? 

If youâ€™re that construction worker and you need to say pay for groceries or medical help. You use that line of credit you have and pay for things with that. Except now you have pulling debt that you need to consider as well as the interest rate son that debt. But letâ€™s say you donâ€™t use your credit card but you have student loans. Those loans are accruing interest. Without your job paying you a regular check how are you paying to keep up with interest?

Yes, your investments will almost certainly be worth X again unless society collapses.

As to when? It is very hard to tell. It's unclear how long COVID and social distancing will affect markets. POTUS's volatility does not inspire confidence in the markets. 

There are some underlying probably with the US economy (I realize that you may not be investing in the US but market panic does spread) for a number of reasons.

However, the Fed seems to be managing the crisis pretty well.

So if you had $0.7X worth of investments, would the best course of action be to sell and hold cash for a while before re-investing? Or would it be better to simply leave your money in and ride it out? Will you be able to tell where the bottom of the market is? If you had the crystal ball, you could be amazingly wealthy. But there's a lot of economic research suggesting that you aren't, really that almost know one is.

There are a few rules of thumb, but the biggest one is that if you don't plan to use you money for a very long time (like if you are investing for your retirement as a young person), the safest strategy is to invest in a diversified portfolio and hold it until closer to when you need it and then start moving more if the money to safer investments like government bonds.",2

Guess what, employer's stock lost 90-something % of its value and it seemed like a once in a lifetime scenario.

People think Buffet is some investing genius because he is an investing genius. He has a 60+ year track record of being an investment genius. The stock didn't go up when he invested somewhere in the late 50's, 60's or 70's. The reason it goes up when he invests there now, is because he has been right so often. He gets white knight deals because people either desperately need cash and he sees value that others with enough cash don't, or because they want him to own their company due to his hands off management style. Buffet is responsible for making value investing as popular as it is today. The man deserves the respect he gets.

To repeat a point above: Mutual funds can be index funds.

Index or actively managed describes how the contents of the fund are chosen. ETF vs mutual fund describes how they trade. You pair one from each set in 4 possible ways.

In fact, index mutual funds from Fidelity have lower expense ratios than any ETF I'm aware of.

However, I don't think that's the point the person you replied to was trying to make. I think they were trying to say that many of the S&P 500 companies have income from sales all around the world (like I can go to Spain or much of Asia and buy a Coca-Cola, drive GM or Ford vehicles in Australia, etc), so you might not need to invest outside the US S&P 500. However, I think this is a very weak argument, as plenty of international companies get a large amount of sales in the US and never hear anyone mention that an international only fund is sufficient, I also haven't seen data that would really support this, while I have seen that using true international holdings can increase returns and lower volatility (these are US focused, but show things that dispute the point I think they were trying to make): [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Domestic/International](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Domestic/International) & [https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/international-investing-myths](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/international-investing-myths)",2

3/21/2020 16:13,Oh my,1
3/21/2020 16:14,"Hi everyone,

I am a 22-year old with access to a $350K line of credit at prime-0.25%, compounded monthly. For those wondering, this rate was granted because I am a professional student. The line of credit will turn into a loan ~5-8 years from today (likely 8 years). Until conversion to a loan, all interest costs come out of the line as long as I do not exceed the limit of $350K (if I do, I must pay the interest costs out of pocket).

Assuming an interest rate of 3% (right now it is 2.7% based on prime rate), I can invest ~$300K today and 5 years from now, my line will be approximately ""maxed out.""

My short-term investment goals are to save for a downpayment on a house in 3-5 years. I would partially rent out the house to keep my interest tax-deductible. I would also pull the equity out of my home at some point an re-invest the funds in either an investment property or more equities.

Right now I have my TFSA, RRSP and non-registered accounts open. My TFSA and RRSP 2020 contribution rooms are $32,488.74 and $3,882.00, respectively. The other $264K will likely go into my non-registered account (unless there are better options?)

Based on tax-laws, what I understand so far is that I should max-out my RRSP with any US-dividend paying stocks/ETFs (APPL, VOO, etc.), max-out my TFSA with any US non-dividend-paying stocks (AMZN, GOOG, etc.) and any Canadian stocks should go into my non-registered.

I have a moderate-high risk threshold, currently make 0 income but will make $60000 starting next year. Currently have ~$4000 in a TFSA, no other assets or liabilities.

I wonder whether it is worth it to invest a portion of my non-reg $264K in US equities. Even though the tax-advantages may not be as favourable, would these missed tax-credits potentially be offset by capital gains in the long-term?

I would also appreciate any investment planning advice from tax-planning to asset allocation to stock selection to nobert's gambit and everything in between. Also, if there is any part of my plan I misunderstood, please let me know.",1

3/21/2020 16:20,">This is false. Many jobs that have you work from home often come with reduced hours and pay. My partner went from payable 60-70 hour weeks to 45 hour weeks. This results in a lower income than excepted and planned. Again many jobs will see reduction in hours as well as temporarily freezing contractors. Letâ€™s say you are a construction worker clearing 100k a year. Suddenly what job site are you working on? Whereâ€™s your income stream? Sure you make 100k net every year but that doesnâ€™t help now that all your work sites arenâ€™t able to continue.

Again, my original comment was that anyone who was laid off **or had their hours reduced** should get a bail out. So I'm agreeing with this point.  My point is that anyone whose pay and hours haven't changed don't need a bailout. Although I am all for a medical bill bailout for anyone that gets sick.

Again, I'm not advocating for corporate bailouts. I want airlines to go bankrupt and we should nationalize air travel.

3/21/2020 16:45,"Hello, hope everyone is getting through this rough patch. I'm looking for some advice for asset allocation in Schwab!

**Me**

Age: 25 - planning to invest monthly for a while and pulling out 20+ years down the line.

Retirement Accounts: Maxed 401k + Roth IRA

If it makes a difference, I'm aiming to invest ~$100k over the next ~24 months.

--------

**Proposed Allocation**

**- ETF [Allocation %] (Expense Ratio)**

- SCHX US Large-Cap [30%] (0.03%)

- SCHG US Large-Cap Growth [15%] (0.04%)

- SCHM US Mid-Cap [15%] (0.04%)

- SCHA US Small-Cap [10%] (0.04%)

- SCHF International Eq [10%] (0.06%)

- SCHE Emerging Markets [10%] (0.11%)

- SCHR Intermediate-Term US Trs Bonds [10%] (0.05%)

- This ultimately comes out to 70% US Stocks, 20% International Stocks, 10% Bonds, with a skew in the US stocks towards ""growth"" over ""value"". 

--------

Generally I'd like advice on whether I'm splitting hairs between a few of these ETFs or if it's worth actually allocating to 5-6 ETFs. For example, I was trying to decide on how to balance SCHX/SCHB/SCHG/SCHV and decided to skip SCHB and then get SCHX as the blend of SCHG + SCHV, while adding some additional SCHG on top. Am I correct in thinking this is generally fine? A little additional risk because I have many years to go before retirement/using this money.

--------

Curious if there's anything else I should be considering - tax considerations, value vs growth, small vs large cap, etc

I've spent several hours reading through Schwab and Morningstar analyses but am still a novice. If anyone has any favorite research sites, that would also be great. Thank you!",1

3/21/2020 17:08,"I'm 36 and have been contributing to my 401(k) and IRAs since the start of my career. I've been following a passive investing approach, but since I am still many years away from retirement I am currently allocated over 90% stocks. At the end of January my 401(k) balance was $430k and its now sitting at $312k, which is a crushing loss. I have a solid emergency fund and even increased my 401(k) contributions to max out by mid year.

I am kicking myself for not switching to cash in my retirement accounts earlier, but that's in the past and there is nothing I can do about it. I feel like things are only going to get worse though.

I never paid too much attention to the stock market til now, but after days of having CNBC on in the background I really get the sense that no one really knows how this will pan out and the ""bottom""  
predictions continue to slide. Here are the things I've gathered:

\- The market hates uncertainty  
\- The market is based on expectations of the future  
\- The bottom of the market should occur before the peak of the virus occurs  
\- Unemployment is going to be off the charts  
\- No one knows how bad of a recession we will have

Every article and resource I can find online seems to steer people toward staying the course, which makes sense through ups and downs, but this feels like a whole different ball game.

What do you think I should do within the next few days? Stay the course? Convert some or all retirement to cash until things settle down? Wait to see how the market reacts to the stimulus? If I do convert to cash do you think drops to come will overshadow the eventual rebound and allow enough time to get back in?

I'm starting to lose sleep over this, even though I'm confident in the very long run I will be able to eventually retire fairly comfortably regardless of the approach I take. Any help is appreciated.",3

Intelligent investor by Ben Graham and Principles of big debt crises - Ray Dalio.

Think if it this way, if you blow your 10k now how likely is it that you will invest again. This is a life skill and if you get to understand it soon it will serve you well for a long time.

P.s. the market is fucking wild right now, with a bigger shitstorm to follow. Right now we are seeing a credit crunch, with what appears to be a lot of money printing to follow. If you invest now prepare for alot of heartache.

3/21/2020 17:27,"It is worth remembering that all these high yield paying stock may cut their dividends at any time to build cash reserves. That being said, they dropped so much already that any further drop is just a buying opportunity. We will know the exact bottom only after the fact, but the whole market will bounce back and forth at the bottom, until it finally bounces back up quickly. It's is going to be a U shape, instead of L or even V, but the bottom of the U is going to last potentially 3-6 months.

MFD looks interesting. I could see the government putting some money on infra once the dust settles, to create more jobs. Will look into that sector more.

Here are some smallcaps, ETFs, sectors (and yeah, some medium, large caps too) that I am looking into.

REM (and even CLNY) is worth having some exposure too. They are getting hammered, but they will recover nicely down the line. Very low interest rate are here to stay, for at least, a year, so that should soften the blow.

I am keeping an eye on Casino, like BJK, because once sky is fully clear, people will be flying / driving there shortly after, gamblers be gamblers. Looking to buy on a further drop.

I am also looking into buying gym companies (esp. PLNT and WW) on a further drop, they may even bounce back before Casinos. BFIT, the ETF, did not drop much as it has a bunch of other companies lumped into it, not as much upside opportunities.

I know you said no oil/travel, but I believe an investment on DIG PESC on a further drop will eventually bounce back significantly. Even some exposure on JETS is worth considering for a 12 months time frame.

Cruise companies (CCl, RCL, NCLH) are going to be dead in the water for a long time though. People plan cruises well ahead of time, and the idea of being stuck in a virus ridden cruise-ship is going to stain their reputation for a long time.

3/21/2020 17:28,"Yes, I read that one. When it comes to these things, assumptions made about tactics are absolutely crucial. It's very hard to model contact tracing, testing, and quarantining. Especially when those methods can evolve over time and have different success rates depending on culture, government structure, etc.

Something else I didn't see discussed at all would be how our approach evolves if remdesivir or hydroxychloroquine pan out. To the degree to which they pan out which is also TBD. This is why I don't like betting on models, even if the models are conducted by experts. They can't take into account new unexpected developments. By the way, to be fair, I also think there's some chance of an additional negative unexpected event or events, such as war, viral mutation, a part of the financial system that buckles, etc. But on the positive front, did you read the study published out of Marseille? It basically showed that 100% of those treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin came out of COVID-19 okay. Now granted, only 1-8% of people who get it die so it could be chance. But the control group took much longer to get better; the treatment group got better in a matter of 6 days, with significantly improved outcomes after 3 days. It's not a randomized double-blind study, but it's a very encouraging case study, and it did get a journal publish. If this really does pan out for people, perhaps we could just let everyone get sick and treat them with this prescription very quickly. This way, perhaps hospitalizations would be limited to just the very old, and some would die at perhaps flu rates, but we could all just get the virus, and get on with our lives.",1

The disconnect in spot price is a big source of discussion over there. Suffice to say, producers have weighed in, and it is indeed demand related.

There is no guarantee that silver is going to snap back right away. We are in the middle of a major deflationary crisis. Silver is largely an industrial metal, so it can come down further in price. There are profitable producers at $8, so look for something around there as a possible floor, potentially lower if deflation reduces All In Sustaining Costs. Silver price may decouple further from gold. Look for signs of inflation rather than deflation before investing.

3/21/2020 18:09,"Timing the absolute top and absolute bottom of the market is near impossible. Recognizing when the market is in stupid bubble territory and overdue for a correction isn't actually that hard. You might get out a little too early or a little too late, but you miss most of the drop. Getting back in is tricky, but not as hard as people make it out to be. Wait until the market is already recovering, not might be recovering. You might miss the first 10-20% of gains off the absolute bottom, but you also sat out during the majority of the fall so it doesn't matter. 

I'll get downvoted to hell for saying this, but I saw it first hand during the last recession. I was on a money board at the time, and was one of the people telling the contrarians not to try and time the market. It's impossible. DCA through it. All the usual shit. 

The ones who sold in late 07 and bought back in early 09 thought the whole thing was so obvious that they must have been missing something. They made a killing. Some of them waited until later in 09 to get back in. They theoretically ""missed"" all the rebound off the bottom, but they still sold high, bought back in lower, and rode the gains for the next decade.

I've been less of a buy and hold forever no matter what type dude since then.

As to airlines and cruise ships. Airlines are vital and will get bailed out, but those bailouts may wipe out investors. Cruise ships are foreign companies that keep the ships registered in foreign countries to avoid US taxes. Yes all their profits come from US tourists, but with everything else going to shit there will be some resistance to bailing them out. Some of them will probably go bankrupt. Even if they survive, if we're in the middle of a recession, and seniors just saw their portfolios get wacked, how quickly do you really think they'll be going back to booking cruises?

I'd also point out that trying to pick individual stocks or sectors is even harder than timing the market. The professionals on Wall St get paid ridiculous sums to do it, and the vast majority are awful at it.",6

Since the market has historically gone up more than its gone down, both in frequency of up days and in total, it makes sense statistically to buy regularly and hold to get the average long term return.

>The number of jobs (""total non-farm payrolls"" which includes both private sector and government jobs) reached a peak of 138.4 million in January 2008, then fell to a trough (bottom) of 129.7 million in February 2010, a decline of nearly 8.8 million jobs or 6.8%. The number of jobs did not regain the January 2008 level until May 2014. For comparison, the severe 1981-82 recession had a jobs decline of 3.2%.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession_in_the_United_States#cite_note-FRED_Payems-50) Full-time employment did not regain its pre-crisis level until August 2015.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession_in_the_United_States#cite_note-52)

&#x200B;

what you should notice is that by the time unemployment rates came back down to normal, the market had made incredible gains. the lowest close for the S&P 500 was, what, 675 or so? by 2014 it was topping 2,000 if i recall correctly.

3/21/2020 18:21,"YOLO All the way! Lol

Joking aside, if you work at Amazon warehouse for 3 years to save that 10k, you probably don't want to lose that 10k. I don't think working at the Amazon warehouse pays very highly.

Options is a way to amplify leverage. You use this when you don't have money, but you know what you're doing. Multiple ways of doing leverage, but the problem with leverage is that you lose your money quickly.

People who have their 401k in ETFs, bonds and stockmarket are having a bloodbath. 401k is money they can't withdraw. I have 35k in 401k and I thought i would be OK last month. I now have a balance of 25k in my 401k because i didn't move this last month to bonds. I thought about doing this when I saw the yield curve, but neglected to do this. I have lost 10k that I can't use, and I struggle to not sell right now. This is WITHOUT leverage.

I would suggest you go to r/personalfinance to see what you should do with your money.  Real estate in the next two years (maybe dont buy in the next year though) will do very nicely and you can use that 10k as down payment. 

If you insist, and decide to do options anyway, install robinhood and make your way to r/wallstreetbets.

Good luck!

EDIT: Just saw your post history and you did try posting in r/personalfinance. Go read up on real estate. I am telling you, the next year will be full of uncertainty, and cash is king for this next year.  Bond might be OK too but they are expensive. Anything with leverage, you'll lose your money in the blink of an eye, because of the market's volatility this next year.",1

3/21/2020 18:34,"If you bought TECL 10 years ago, you would've done extremely well. No guarantee this happens again. What's going on here is that tech stocks have had an amazing bull run. The largest companies in the market are now all tech stocks. S&P 500 is now about 20%-25% ""tech"" as wide as that term is. Tech will some day stop being the best performing sector some day.

Leverage magnifies returns, and TECL magnifies market percentage return by 3x each day. Due to daily rebalancing, it probably performed better than 3x the index over the 10-year (at least until coronavirus). Levered funds also suffer from tracking errors, as in you will not always get 3x the percentage return every day.

Leverage can get dangerous if you don't understand what it does to portfolio and your returns. Stocks are volatile and tech stocks are more volatile than the general stock market. It's not ""suitable"" to a general investor because a general investor doesn't deal in levered portfolios. Obviously, with leverage, TECL can fall very quickly and very much, which is what happened the last few weeks.

""Decay"" or ""volatility drag"" obviously hasn't killed the return over 10 years. Neither did the expense ratio over 1%, though it did reduced the return. Decay simply means a leveraged strategy with rebalancing will not do well in a volatile sideways market. It's simply a consequence of compounding, daily in this case. Rebalancing is required to not blow up leverage as market falls, and to lever back up as market rises.",1

Exxon 2 year leaps again.. 30% out of the money.  10% of portfolio

Alphabet - Because it will be priced at the discount of a lifetime - 10% of portfolio buy straight shares. (One doesn't simply play in Alphabet options)

Microsoft - 2 year leaps again,  30% out of the money.  10% of portfolio

3M - 2 year leaps again,  30% out of the money.  10% of portfolio.  Also have been to their corporate retreat - They know how to treat their best employees right. (G5 baby!!!!)

Disney  -   2 year leaps again,  30% out of the money.  20% of portfolio.

UPS  - Transportation stock and the only one I'm willing to play in after  the crash.  I like FedEx and have invested in them in the past, I just  prefer the logistics skills at UPS.   2 year leaps again,  30% out of  the money.  10% of portfolio.   \*Note if you invest in FedEx you'll win just as easily.

PG&E -  California's energy company... yes they are going through bankruptcy, yes this is the riskiest play in the portfolio, it's also one that is virtually assured to improve rapidly.  2 year leaps, 30% of of the money, 10% of your portfolio.

3/21/2020 18:57,"I'm a chemical engineer with a bio chem focus and a math minor.  I'm aware of exponential growth.  

Here is my take on it.  I'm gonna use china numbers.

Most virus take about a week to show symptoms if they even do.  You have liars every year that say didn't get the cold or flu, except they did without symptoms nor ever knowing.  This spreads during that asymptomatic stage.  Now everyone's immune system is different, but immune response ( symptoms) are going to be a function of viral load.  It will be another 1-2 weeks....we will call that 1.5 weeks, for symptoms to get bad enough to seek medical treatment or in general, people saying, why haven't I kicked this?  I better go to the doctor.  So 2.5 weeks from initial infection of people passing this around before they entered quarantine.   People are starting their 2.5 week cycle everyday.   For just wuhan, the city has a population of 11 million, its dense, lots of smokers.  Smokers dont disinfect between drags of their cigarettes and constantly touch railings and stuff....   that spread heavily.  ( this is where exponential growth is being factored in).  

I have no reason to believe the Chinese numbers were inaccurate,  they were limited by capacity to test.  More cases than they could test for would be what would be suspicious.  When they switched to just symptom based confirmation, their daily numbers more than doubled.  Easily 10x cases ( being conservative) as opposed to confirmed cases.  The percents are all off too since they would be prioritizing testing of those that need care over the symptomatic cases that seemed mild.  They're confirming the worst cases and not counting the mild cases.....   a few deaths may have slipped through, but their group is over represented to begin with.  

Notice china doesnt have a significant amount of new cases?  The most reasonable assumption is that most of them were infected during the lockdown and had mostly minor cases.  Peak is over.   


I dont know your wife's modeling, but I've seen others report similar time frames and they aren't accounting for all the unconfirmed / unknown cases.  They should be aggressively accounted for.  Being cautious is for the CDC and WHO only.",1

Then, no one else wants to move on it.

The other thing about Buffet, he does not like to sell shares at all. He keeps an index rolling for the long term. Conversely, he could have already purchased enough shares late 2019 and sees early 2020 as too volatile. This is just my 2 centavos.",1

3/21/2020 19:08,"I believe these are mutually exclusive.  Conversions can happen any time independently of after tax IRA contributions. So if ur asking ""do I still have time to contribute up to 6K and have it count towards my 2019 limit?"" then yes you do.

Also, 401K is like Las Vegas: what happens inside stays inside. So for example, say you converted 20K of pretax money in ur 401K to Roth 401k. This has no impact on ur 6K limit. 

But lets say you left ur previous job and rolled over 20K pretax from 401K to Traditional IRA. And then decided to convert that to Roth IRA. Again no impact. That limit is only towards new money.

Just remember there are income limits. I think if u make over 137K a year you can't directly contribute.  If u make less than 122K you can do the whole 6K. In between is a reduced amount.",1

i have to clue where the bottom will be. if there's one thing ive learned (trading crypto), don't be greedy. take your gains and get out. just keep an eye on things. stay on top of the news. check daily. keep track on things during the weekend. 

&#x200B;

a vaccine, a way to stabilize or reduce the effects of CV19,  CV19 dying out on its own. stuff like that is going to start the trigger for a bottom. IMO. i think our recovery will be slow and we'll likely go sideways for a  few weeks-months. as our current state is causing a lot of damage that won't be fixed with a cure. unemployment, home-losses, foreclosures, people unable to pay their debts. those things will linger for months.",1
3/21/2020 19:31,"Thereâ€™s two reasons we havenâ€™t heard from Buffett yet:

1. This is almost definitely not the bottom. It hasnâ€™t even been a month yet-thereâ€™s a million and one things that can change now. And as long as the virus is still spreading faster than itâ€™s being stamped out-we have no reason to think the market will get better-even a stimulus package wonâ€™t fix the fundamental issues-only stop them from getting worse. 

Buffett has no reason to rush. Picture the bear market starting last week as Buffett the giant waking up from a 10 year bull sleep. Right now heâ€™s still getting out of bed, shufling to the kitchen to make some coffee while wearing his slippers and a bath robe. 

Heâ€™s moving slow because he has no reason to move faster. 

2. Buffett isnâ€™t looking at buying stocks nearly as much as he is buying full companies. Those situations take months and months to hammer out before it gets announced to the public. So, if he does start moving this week, which he probably wonâ€™t, itâ€™ll be months before any deal actually closes",1

Warren makes these kinds of deals even in strong economic times and is always in communication with people who want to arrange something or another. You can bet his phone is ringing off the hook.

That doesn't mean I or anyone else on this subreddit has any knowledge of specifics of ongoing deals. But you can absolutely do a little research into deals that he has made in the past. A few companies where Warren has made big deals: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Salomon Brothers, Occidental Petroleum. Usually he gets some kind of preferred stock, often convertible into shares, which is like a combination of a junior bond and a call option.

The Fed injecting liquidity is one big difference between this and 1929. They did zero of that back then. On the contrary, the Fed of that day actively tried to bring the market down.

> Buffett's first investment in Bank of America came in the form of preferred stock. Still reeling from the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis and the missteps of its former management, Bank of America found itself as a defendant in a hefty $10 billion lawsuit and thus found itself in need of capital. **Enter Buffett, who in 2011 offered the bank $5 billion in the form of preferred stock, a type of security that's senior to the common equity but junior to a bond or note. Buffett's preferred shares yielded 6%, but even more important, they came with warrants to purchase 700,000[,000] shares of Bank of America stock at a fixed price of $7.14 per share at any time over the following 10 years -- i.e., by 2021.**

Note that 700,000 shares should be [700 million shares](https://www.brightscope.com/financial-planning/advice/article/4976/Annual-Buffett-Letter/) (On Banking section) $5b/700m = $7.14 a share.

Originally, the Fed wanted US treasuries as security for overnight loans between banks. But the banks became uneasy and were starting to demand higher interest rates than normal.

At this point, the loans are no longer ""overnight,"" necessarily, and junk collateral is acceptable. The Fed itself is providing the liquidity.

I know no one can predict the future and timing the market is near impossible but based on the latest news reports I am expecting we have much further to crash yet. Would it therefore be wise to diversify a significant portion of my portfolio into bonds or other investments before moving them back into equities at a later date?

I am an under 30s male not planning to use the cash for many years but it is quite unnerving seeing such a drop in my net worth.",1

3/21/2020 21:14,it would show if jobs in a job matket are terrible wastes of time or reasonable jobs that lives can be built on.  the unemployment rate is supposed to do that but it's hopelessly outdated.,4

3/21/2020 21:15,4.9% is not insignificant. I know it's not 1 to 1. But if the unemployment rate was increased by 4.9% we would've been in the 8% unemployed range.,-3

Pretty hilarious in hindsight.  

AAPL was at ~$15/share.  AMZN at $70.  NFLX at $5.",1

3/21/2020 21:16,"I would definitely sell and diversify in your situation. I am a big fan of index funds and would also recommend them. Look at a 3 fund portfolio. That is US index fund, international index fund, and maybe some bond index fund. You would then generally increase the bond allocation as you get older and keep the US to international index fund in some proportion like 75%us 25% international.

3/21/2020 21:17,Enough DD here to short the economy another 70%,6
3/21/2020 21:17,"Couple of folks in this sub agree with you. Couldn't find the post, but someone did a day by day comparison of the crash of 1929 and it was very similar to today, however the situation is different.

There was another post that predicted another housing market collapse in the near future due to the fact that unemployment is skyrocketing, HUD is suspending foreclosures through the month of april, and some banks are offering 6% interest rates on mortgages and refis. 

I have no idea what will happen, but I try to take everything from this sub and make my decisions. I sold off investments a couple of weeks ago and am sitting about 85% liquid as I think the market will go down further. If not, that's ok as I was able to prevent additional losses. 

I'm also planning on keeping a bit of cash on hand in the event the RE market does decline then I'll pick up a property or two.",3
3/21/2020 21:18,We're in the preludes of a credit crisis. The market was looking for any excuse to price it in and the pandemic became its excuse.,6
3/21/2020 21:18,">Is there any possibility of losing it all if I do nothing and leave it? I don't want to sell now but $230k is better than $115k, or $0.

Adding something that I haven't seen yet. Let's assume this is true. Let's assume this thing is so bad that the ENTIRE market goes to 0.

If that happens it's worldwide financial collapse. It doesn't matter if you have $230k or $115k - your money is worthless anyways. Moreover if it's in a bank or brokerage (just not invested) there's 0 chance you can convert it to cash in that situation. The only things of value in this case would be items with intrinsic value such as gold, food, or likely weapons or whatever labor you can offer.

This situation is also accompanied by martial law among other consequences you really don't want to deal with. The point is, planning for the apocalypse is an exercise in futility. The world will be so radically different that it's not worth considering.

It's ALSO a huge waste of money to do that because it's not going to happen. So leave your 401k alone.",1
3/21/2020 21:18,I wouldn't buy just yet- I'm holding off myself until the way back up.,3

Growing up in the hood you notice certain businesses that designate where you are. Dollar Tree, Boost mobile, random gas station, Chinese #1, Walmart, McDonald's. It's not uncommon for one person to work at more than one of those locations.",0
3/21/2020 21:20,How can you still invest in 2019?,1
3/21/2020 21:21,"That was a good thought process overall. But there is still a tiny bit of gamble wouldn't you think? For example, there are thousands of scientists all over the world actively trying to find a vaccine and treatment for covid. In china alone, there must be hundreds, if not thousands of scientists that had a head start on vaccine development. Vaccine development is a sure shot thing, it is only a matter of time. It only needed one scientist to get a big break on vaccine and the whole corona thing was done for. Of course, it hasn't happened yet, and it worked out very well for you, but you know, just something to think about.",0

3/21/2020 21:24,"I realize that. There is no perfect system for counting it, but I know that the number of people claiming benefits has to do with it. This figure has been misleading because eventually people run out of unemployment. Another misleading figure is job growth. It doesn't make a distinction between full and part time jobs.",2
3/21/2020 21:24,He's probably trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. He doesn't just YOLO on stocks only because prices went down.,1

3/21/2020 21:26,"One thing that I think about is how every crisis of the 21th century has been relatively unprecedented. 

Imagine trying to come up with an investment plan after 9/11, an unprecedented event. Or thinking what to do at a time when the biggest banks in the world were simultaneously looking at a bankruptcy risk. 


Through all of these crisis the pattern has always been the same, things will be shit for a while, maybe even a couple of years. But being invested in strong companies and periodically adding to those investments, has ALWAYS been a successful tactic.",3

GDP = C+G+I+NX ours has been driven by C for the past few years. Our NX has been service based which can be done from home. Everything was pumped into C gov't spending didn't go to infrastructure but rather tax cuts to inflate C.

There has been plenty of data to show the equation was out of balance and too much focus was being placed on C.",1
3/21/2020 21:28,"what helps me tremendously in times like these, is opening a historic chart of the s&p500 and just looking at what happened around big events. 9/11, financial crisis etc. All of those times, unprecedented things happened that would change life forever etc etc.

Look at the graphs. The market recovers every time! Even from the great depression! Wars and global nuke scares etc etc, the market over the long term goes up, because we as a species are resilient as fk.  


And honestly if your portfolio does go to 0, that means the entire fucking global economy is trashed, aka every business in the world is bankrupt. If that happens, money isn't going to help you anyways and you'll need canned food and guns n sht lol.   


Most importantly of all, killing yourself is not the solution, if you are really considering suicide call the suicide hotline, there is no shame in talking to someone.",2
3/21/2020 21:28,"Market's already dropped 30% with no signs of recovery in sight. I've also doubled my portfolio's value using put options. Luck plays no part in this. It's also telling that you think one needs to time the exact bottom to come out of this ahead. 

There is a clear set of heuristics for when to buy back in that anyone with a clue is paying attention to:

- supply shock concerns alleviated
- corona situation is handled
- bank liquidity crisis issues handled
- people returning back to work, businesses stop going bankrupt and are recovering
- more

If this is all luck to you, just stick to index funds.",1
3/21/2020 21:28,"I guess you were oblivious to the fact that in 1914-1918 the world went through the First World War where millions died and all of the belligerent nations were left destroyed, destitute and bankrupt. US was the only country to come out of that virtually unscathed and became the financial center of the known world instead of London. Yeah... maybe that might have had something to do with the roaring twenties...",4

I'd argue that helicopter money achieves better the core goals of a jobs program, because it allows people to make decisions that benefit them the most. For example, lets say we're putting people to work paving highways, or building dams. They have to be brought onboard and trained, and that's pretty expensive. And it's likely they'll leave the program as soon as the economy recovers. Not to mention, the supply of concrete/heavy machinery etc would have to expand overnight to put these people to work, else they'll be sitting idle. Throwing a ton of money at jobs programs is kind of like if we threw a lot of money into making mask factories right now--by the time they come online , they may not even be necessary.

Thing is there are professional analysts that work for hedge funds who are also looking at Marriot and Delta airlines etc. Anything an analysis may predict is already priced in, at least the mathematical parts of it (balance sheet etc).

So why not just do a very, very simple analysis? Just go with your sentiment, why not?

Higher risk brings higher potential rewards. Airliners etc are now making less money, are more likely to fail etc, thus their prices are now lower. This makes airliners right now a risky investment, with a potentially high payoff (because if they do survive, then the price will climb quick too).

3/21/2020 22:17,"Other variables aside, more liquidity causes less volatility. Think about it: if a lot of people want to buy or sell an asset, there will be many people willing to buy or sell it at similar price points.

If a big buyer comes in and liquidity is high (many people are buying and selling), heâ€™ll make little impact on the volume negotiated. If liquidity is low, people will notice this person has a very high interest on the asset and will raise prices, increasing volatility.

Just think about jumping in a bathtub and a pool. The bathtub would be a market with little liquidity (no pun intended), and when you got in, the water level would change a lot (volatility). The pool would be a very liquid market, where many people can get in an out without changing the water level.",2

3/21/2020 22:21,"More weird than dystopic. 

The fed has made mistakes in the past. In the 70s they put too much money into the economy, and inflation exceeded 10%. So if you had $10,000 in the bank it was worth about $9,000 just one year later. That's really really bad. So they had to lower the amount of money available which did lower inflation back down to normal levels, but it caused a recession in the early 80s. When you reduce the money supply dramatically, a recession is pretty sure to follow. 

So the hope is that they don't overreact in this situation or it could make things much worse.",1
