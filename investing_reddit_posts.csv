2011-08-12 11:40:22,"Trading? Yup, there's a Subreddit for that.","http://www.reddit.com/r/trading or http://www.reddit.com/r/traders or http://www.reddit.com/r/daytraders

**Context:** When someone new, young and unexperienced comes and asks what to do with some spare money they have, I personally think it is irresponsible to direct them toward individual stock picking, let alone active options trading. Those choices are difficult at best, speculative at worst. Someone with a few thousand dollars and one year should not be putting it all on the line like that.

**Introductions:** Part of what keeps people from investing is the thought that it is too difficult to learn and requires active work - thus, IMHO, best to keep it simple at *least* at first for folks. If they *want* to learn more about trading, and/or you want to discuss active trading more than long-term investing, there is a Reddit just waiting to happen for all of that :D

**Consequences:** Also, early experiences with investing can be very formative - if someone jumps in, buys a stock and it tanks, one might *hope* they would sit back and learn from that, but one could *worry* they'd then give up on the market and/or investing in general.

**Controversy:** Anyway, I realize we aren't all going to agree on the passive-versus-active approach debate, and that's fine, but for those just starting out I hope we can focus on solutions that are balanced, diversified, simple, cost- and tax-efficient, rather than weighing people down with the idea that they have to learn an entire discipline from scratch to survive and succeed. ;)

Open to alternative points of view, though, and hope this didn't come out as too judgmental ... I just saw a thread that really got me thinking about how scary it can be to be starting out.

**Edit: to reiterate my concluding paragraph, in bold - I'm not trying to say we shouldn't have an open discussion on all investing topics, but please, let's be responsible adults and not encourage people to gamble with their initial investments, or start out by speculating rather than actually investing**",1,27

2011-11-09 11:46:35,StockJock-e shouldn't be a mod for r/investing,"I was pretty shocked to see that StockJock-e was added to the mod list for r/investing since he's here mainly to spread dubious investing advice to bring attention to his penny stock forum.  A while back, r/investing was overrun by spammers, and I think it might happen again with StockJock-e at the helm. 

StockJock-e has created a sub-reddit dedicated to the promotion of his penny stock forum and refers to it frequently in his posts on r/investing (his sub-reddit is r/thestockmarket, his penny stock forum is hotstockmarket.com).  With his mod power, there's no telling what he'll eventually turn r/investing into. 

r/investing is an important sub-reddit to defend because this is the first place redditors go to get investing related advice.  I truly believe StockJock-e should be removed from the mod team before he is able to overrun this place with spam like his sub-reddit r/thestockmarket.  

Also, to any beginners that believe that StockJock-e's posts contain any valuable information, after a while, you'll realize he likes to use a lot of fancy buzz words to appears smarter than he is.  Coming from someone who knows a lot about how the stock market works, I can tell you with a straight face that StockJock-e is all talk.  It's comforting to get answers from someone on such a mysterious thing as the stock market, but I can assure you his answers and explanations are pure drivel.  I'm not attacking TA, but his implementation and explanations of TA are very unsound.  

Anyway, I'm done with my rant, I hope I'm not the only redditor that is concerned about this.  

**This is a response to unforgyvn's request for more information about my claims:**

StockJock-e has been wrong on many occasions, and sometimes spectacularly wrong.  One example of this is the post where he stated how obvious a bearish move in the S&P would be only to have the index rally for 5 straight days in a row.  For him to believe that a move in the stock market is *obvious* is bad enough, I really don’t have a problem when he’s wrong (no one can be right all of the time), it's the way he tries to explain his incorrect predictions.  

When StockJock-e is wrong there are several things he does to make it seem like he's not really at fault. The first thing is he just refers to his disclaimer about how unwise it is to listen to people on the internet about stocks.  So basically, if he's right, he's a smart guy, if he's wrong, you're a not a smart guy for listening to him.  This is just one way he protects himself, but there's more.  

He has in the past explained his incorrect predictions by saying that a short squeeze in the markets was what caused him to be incorrect.  Even if there were enough short term speculators to actually move the S&P with a short squeeze, how would StockJock-e have the transaction data from every market participant to say whether a short term rally was indeed caused by a short squeeze.  There are more than just speculators out there.  Large institutions participate in the markets to both hedge their exposures, and realize arbitrage profit.  If the market consisted only of short term speculators, this would be a more likely possibility, but again, StockJock-e has no way of really backing up this claim with any hard numbers or data.  This is an example of using fancy buzzwords to hide mistakes and replace real analysis.  

Next, in the past, if the market moves against him, he'll cite CNBC bringing out the bulls if he's bearish, or the bears if he's bullish.  It's not his fault that he's wrong, but CNBC's.  It is simply untrue that CNBC decides where the market moves, they merely report on what's happening.  This is another example of how StockJock-e will pretend to have some special inside understanding of the stock market when he's really just trying to hide his mistakes with mumbo-jumbo.  

Even if StockJock-e is wrong sometimes, and even if he's unable to properly explain why he's wrong, it shouldn't matter if he's able to consistently make money from the stock market, right?  Now, this is just my own guessing, but if it were easy for StockJock-e to make money on stocks, I don't see why he would be promoting his money making site on reddit.  If the majority of the people here support StockJock-e, that’s fine I really can’t control what you believe as good or bad, but I really think there are real problems with his motivations and the content of his posts.

2011-11-23 21:28:51,Thoughts from a self made millionaire.,"I've got a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.


.


I'm a retired millionaire in my mid 30's with portfolio assets in 8 figures who started with absolutely nothing, wasn't a trust fund baby, nor had anything handed to them...I am completely self made keeping a laser sharp focus on my goals and hitting every one of them.

I roughly double my entire portfolio assets approximately every 2 years and have been doing so every 2 years consistently for over 14 years running...you read correctly...input that into the rule of 72 and have some fun with it.


.


**The following is neither a buy/sell recommendation nor in any way to be thought of as financial advice of any kind.  In fact, so there is no legal bullshit, I am telling everyone outright NOT to follow me on this execution in any way.** 


.


It is simply a statement of fact of executions I have already put into play to show you IN ADVANCE of things happening to show that anyone who is willing to do the math/preparation, save, and invest can yield huge gains without the aid of a ""stock adviser"".  In fact, I believe that 99.999999% of stock ""advisers"" are snake oil salesmen who are in it to push shitty products onto you just to generate commissions and advance their own careers/agenda.

.


Also, it provides proof of concept that anyone can do what I have done since I have received countless counter claims that it's ""impossible"" to reach 8 figure assets in such a short time from zero.

.


So here it is with an **18 month timeframe** from today's date Nov 23, 11.  I will be investing a minimum of $2 million.

.



[Chesapeake Energy Corporation](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=chk) stock ticker CHK

NOTE:  The link is to yahoo finance and is DYNAMIC so the price link will change, so for reference as of Nov 23, 11 the close price is $22.71 not including any after hours.

1) set to buy at $19
2) will continue to buy all the way down in 50 cent increments from the base $19 buy at a minimum of $100,000 a pop.


3) will set initial sell at $30 at 75% of total assets invested.  Do the math kids, over 50% gains.
4) will sell at increments of 50 cents at 10% of remaining assets invested until assets completed or until $32 is reached, at which point I will completely sell.

Again, plan of action is 18 month time frame for executions.  

**I encourage all of you to feel free to take screenshots to ensure that I do not go back and in any way change any of the data here.**


I of course am and will be investing in other ventures and this is not my only stock trade in motion.  It's simply ONE I've decided to share.  It's not even close to my biggest gainer picks.  As of today's date, my portfolio is up over 125%.

I don't give a single fuck if you believe or don't believe. The sun will still rise tomorrow and I'll still be living the good life...with or without your approval.  I've accomplished so many things in my life both inside and outside of investing at such a young age in such a short time because I have the balls and resolve to do them with laser focus.  The purpose of this post is to give a wake up call to the very small minority here who will decide to change their ways of being slaves to their jobs/debt and take the path less traveled:  learning how to invest for themselves and learning the principals of living far below your means in order to get there.  The small minority who will choose to become masters of their own destiny instead of being content with being a brick in the wall or at the mercy of an employer or job, that might not be there in the future, for their income.  There are very few excuses someone has, if they've worked hard not to accumulate any debt and from a starting point of zero, not to be comfortably retired in 20 years living very well solely off interest gained.  Problem is most people don't have the balls or resolve to live far below their means, save adequately, not accumulate debt, learn to do the math for themselves and NOT have an “adviser” tell you what to buy, and keep their eye on the prize.

[Here are the principals I use to get where I am.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kz2b6/how_would_reddit_react_to_a_selfmade_millionaire/c2ofiv6)

2012-04-04 00:47:41,Please r/Investing - Remember your reddiquette,"Evening all,

Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rrf2t/what_happened_to_reddiquette_did_it_die/) thread from r/askreddit as well as a couple instances I have witnessed recently, I want to appeal to the better side of all of us in hopes we can have more open and lively discussions in this subreddit.

Specifically, I posted in the [thread about educational backgrounds](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rlj4h/redditors_of_rinvesting_what_are_your_educational/) and was voted down.  I contributed and was completely on topic, yet I was voted down.  I know there are some folks that don't like me or my market philosophies but voting down my education is just plain rude.  

Further, just a moment ago I witnessed someone who also contributed on topic to a different thread and they were voted down.  I can't say for sure why but venturing a guess it was because they mentioned gold.  They mentioned it as an example of diversification.

There are plenty of other examples but the point is, this subreddit would have more **quality** contributions if we were a little less quick to vote down submissions and comments just because we don't agree with someone's point of view.

If you haven't read it lately, please do - [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) - tl;dr? here some of the highlights:

* Keep your submission titles factual and opinion-free.

* Moderate [vote] based on quality, not opinion

* Search for duplicates before posting.

* Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something

* Actually read an article before you vote on it

* Don't downvote opinions just because you disagree with them.

* Don't downvote opinions just because they are critical of you.

* Don't editorialize or sensationalize your submission title

And finally, before anyone calls me out for breaking the **Don't complain about downvotes on your posts** rule...I'm not complaining.  You can downvote me all you want my ego is will be just fine.  This post isn't about me: It's about the newbie who asks a stupid question and gets voted down and it's about the investment professional who comes here only to see a bunch of circle jerking and they walk away having contributed nothing.

*This post is dedicated to the other 2 individuals who were voted down for being educated*

Why:
-----

- They have earnings coming out, which I predict to be bad, even worse than expected.  
  
- Funds will be dumping them regardless, just to depress the stock / get out before the announcement.  
  
- A story just broke a little while ago that called them out on not having enough cash on hand to deal with rising content acquisition costs.  
  
- My broker has shares easily available to short.  
  
- Revenues going up won't help the fact that they are in content acquisition cost trouble.  
  
- And their chart forms a nice recent top with descending action.   
  
Sold short last time around $105, and buy-stop'd at $101.50.

This should be an interesting Monday for LQMT and AAPL, especially with Apple's earnings coming out Tuesday.  Also, because I got tired of being called a troll...","More facts learned during the weekend research:  
  
- Apple paid the $20 Million to license the liquid metal technology to LQMT in 2010, in terms which are not completely disclosed.  It is unlikely that further royalties would be paid by Apple, but not impossible.  What is most lucrative is that the iPhone would 'kick-start' the technology and it would become an *extremely* hot item for lots of different industries.  
  
- Liquidmetal is (getting away from all the magic internet hype) simply a way to form a metal alloy without allowing the atoms to form lattice-like structures, thereby creating a substance that is **2.5 times stronger than Titanium**, but is more flexible and just as light.  This is not magic, but it is pretty fucking amazing.  
  
- Apple would likely be actually producing any liquid metal tech through a secondary manufacturer like Engel or Materion, especially if used in this generation iPhone.    
  
- Apple has spent billions on non-disclosed costs in the past few quarters relating to creating new manufacturing facilities.  
    
- Upon being contacted by news sources for confirmation of the rumors, Apple declined to comment.  
  
So, I'm not saying that LQMT is invincible, but it damn sure is not the dismal penny stock is was a month ago with no hopes.  
  
And I'm damned sure I didn't let the butt-hurts and the haters here convince me not to put 100% of my capital in it Friday morning/afternoon.

Unless every person in the world adopts LNKD as their default homepage in the next 6 months, they are going to fall very hard.  They can only 'massage the numbers' for so long.  
  
I'm not going to go into the accounting technicals.  Look up LinkedIn and GAAP reported earnings if you want a more detailed explanation.  
  
But regardless, even if earnings *do* increase and I am dead wrong, if the share price is driven up to 900 P/E every time earnings increase, then a collapse is eventual anyways.

*""Linked In, on the other hand, has a much more subjective revenue recognition method for its hiring and marketing solutions. Most of the Company’s contractual arrangements include multiple deliverables, i.e., several products packaged together which Linked In swears can’t be pulled apart to record revenue separately. Gee, if the Company’s cost accounting system keeps track of product and service costs separately, why can’t revenue be estimated separately? Interesting question, huh? Anyway, Linked In uses convoluted GAAP criteria to record revenue, the relative selling price method, based on a selling price hierarchy. In short, management decides what revenue will be based on vendor specific evidence, third party evidence, or management’s best estimate of selling price, in that order of priority. Which one do you thing management likely favors?""*  
  
*""Linked In also plays this “game,” but with a new twist. The Company does do something quite interesting…it defers expensing $13.6 million in commissions already paid on non-cancelable subscription contracts, presumably to match the commission costs with the related revenue streams. Why stop there? Couldn’t you make the same argument for a whole host of other expenses as well? Maybe they did, but Deloitte didn’t buy it.""*  
  
*""So, there you have it…lots of revenue and asset valuation assumptions in these internet companies. Do you really believe that these companies with their limited operating histories, and often inexperienced management, are able to make the kind of assumptions and judgments that drive their accounting?

2012-05-04 15:17:21,One of the most important lessons I've learned in my short time: Don't Fight Market Direction!,"It doesn't matter if you're right and it's a good company, *you can't swim against a river*.  
  
I credit a variety of authors, Investor's Business Daily, and my own failed positions for teaching me this lesson.  
  
When we were in a bull market for the first quarter of this year, I'll bet most people who happened to be starting out **thought this thing was easy**: Just pick a stock and watch the money roll in!  
  
But those who plunged their money in Summer of 2008 felt differently.  
  
The lesson is that you might have found an undervalued company, but entry point and market direction are critical as well!  One should never establish new positions in a bear, correction, or uncertain market.  
  
*Similarly, one should never short stocks in a healthy bull market.*
  
Right now we are in uncertain times.  If you look at the major indexes over the past month or so, **it's impossible to tell if the correction we hit in April has run it's course or not**.  
  
**Hence, it is not a good idea to establish new positions right now**, even if it *is* a good long term play.  Also look to cut your losses.  
  
Just think of all the people in 2008 who wish they had cut their losses to 5 to 7%...  
  
*For example:* ATVI's earnings are coming up on the 9th.  *They are going to blow the estimates out of the water*.  Idiots who get paid too much are not considering (or possibly intentionally ignoring) a lot of big revenues that ATVI got this quarter: Diablo 3 presales through the roof, already getting revenue from BLOPS 2 preorders, COD: Elite, Spyro... etc.  But I'm not going to play this one, because the market direction just doesn't show the support I would need to see.

I am really wondering how this will affect Cisco's future reputation and earnings. I can't believe they did what it appears they did. If it's right it's unbelievably stupid.

If you don't understand the technology it is basically as if they secretly ""upgraded"" your car and you could only drive your car now by you steering wheel and gas pedal positions going through their central computers which could record every driving detail as well as cause you to lose control of your car if someone else stole your driving password which would be stored on their computer. Furthermore you can no longer turn the wheel as far or drive as fast because your settings choices have been reduced.

Now imagine you as network admin for your mega company just recommended the purchase of 1000 of such cars a year ago to your bosses and your whole company bought them. Now what do you do as a employee whose recommendation just turned out to be a control seizure and security risk for your company?

Do you EVER recommend to buy from that manufacturer again?

2012-09-30 19:55:48,AAPL with a P/E ratio of 15x does NOT mean it is cheap. ,"I see this all the time and I don't think it's true. 

If x10 is the standard of a fair valuation, then x15 means that Apple will have to grow 50% to justify their *current* price. 

Now, we're talking about the biggest company in the world. While there is a conceivable universe in which Apple manages exponential growth until they rule the world, but the more practical scenario - in at least 100 ways - is that the largest company in the world will not be able to arbitrarily half-again in size, let alone sustain its current prosperity. 

Whatever the case, it betrays your own ignorance to say things like ""Apple is cheap, it's P/E is below the industry average."" That is not how P/E ratios really work. That's like thinking that a stock is cheaper because it just had a split. It isn't.

You have to evaluate everything, and in a variety of contexts. Maybe you do so and you still think Apple will grow like hell, and you could be right. I am not betting either way, because Apple doesn't make much sense to me, and they are definitely killing it. 

But just looking at a P/E ratio and seeing a nice, low number doesn't say anything on its own. You have to think about the practical reality of these things. It's easy to arbitrarily imagine $700 going to $1000, but a little harder to imagine the worlds largest company become 50% more largest. 


Edit: There are some great comments here about what I have said/PE ratios in general. I agree with most of it - this write-up is narrow at best, I got ahead of myself making assertions. Keep up the conversation, PE ratios are a surprisingly complicated concept it seems. 

10x is not ""the standard,"" notice I said ""if,"" and I do believe that 10x PE is what most companies should have in a more reasonable market, but that may be outdated economics by now. I am sure there are many that would consider 15 to be as good as it reasonably gets. 

I am not long or short apple, and this is not a real analysis. I am just trying to point out that calling Apple cheap based on P/E ratio is not a very reliable judgment. ",13,63

I have a good friend who used to work as a medical marijuana (mmj) consultant. He has finally moved out of that field, and he's in a good position to start a large scale cultivation grow operation, due to the amount of patient contracts he now has.

He's asked me if I would like to get in on the action through a private loan, and has presented me with a wealth of information that I've been utilizing in order to decide if I want to or not. I've already looked into all of the legal implications regarding contract structure. I've known this person for a long time, considering we grew up in the same town, and he's always been a very honest standup guy. This fact that he is a honest friend, as well as the unprecedented returns, make me feel as though I'm very lucky.

The question I have for you r/investing is regarding how much, and what style of investment I should make. 

The options I have talked over my lawyer with, as well as his are as follows. In addition, if you have another option I should consider, please PM me or leave a message.

* 1yr High Interest Loan - 30% Annual interest Paid out 5 times a year

* Fixed 3yr High Interest Loan - 20% Annual Interest Paid out 5 times a year

* Obtaining a share of the profits, Fixed/Non Fixed Options at 5%-12% Annually, Paid out 5 times a year, based on the size of the investment

The third option is the option I have been leaning towards, but he been very upfront as well as research has proven that gross are not 100% eventhough fully up to state/county code due to the Feds. While very unlikely, it still faces a certain risk.

2013-01-01 15:01:27,Fundamental vs. Technical ,"I’ve had a bit more time than usually to watch Bloomberg and BNN on TV over the holidays. And it has really hit me what and who uses fundamentals. For us small folk, we can rely on the services to provide us with some of the information, but realistically, unless you have the means to understand the industry, the accounting, corporate strategies and whatever else that is included, then really, fundamentals are useless to you.  Don’t get me wrong, many people are able to trade successfully on fundamentals. Im sure they are. But who would know everything about fundamentals, government policies, events and the like and then be able to piece it all together other than the market makers? 

Peons such as us only have CRAMER, CNBC, Bloomberg and all those other services. The problem is, they are ALWAYS LATE. Early Thursday morning (dec 27th), the headlines read to the effect that American futures dropped on poor housing starts and unemployment. Later on that day, the market pops right back up. The headlines disappear and are replaced by Bernake’s statement about employment or whatever other garbage they want. I love reading/watching the headlines before the market opens. Almost always, when the new reporters are very excitedly bullish, it is time to start shorting the market. And when they are gloomy with no chance of recovery, you should go long. It sounds comical, but most often is true. 

Ever given thought to the Goldman accusation, that when the company was going short on some stocks, they told their loyal customers, well they “recommended” some of their loyal customer to buy said stocks. Please buy this stock because we are exiting our long positions to go short. We will provide the liquidity you need to take out all of our long positions. I don’t know if that is how they decided things would work, but that is what is necessary for a distribution to happen based on bad fundamentals findings on whatever entity will be traded. As the news breaks about the not so rosy fundamental aspects, the market or stock is primed to fall and you the investor is left holding the bag.  

In all honesty, the basis for the market moving the way it does is truly based on pure fundamentals. Market makers and large institutions are responsible for setting up the market for whatever it does. Since they buy and sell just like we do and make available the necessary liquidity to move the market one way or another, we can track what they are doing from our charts! 

I poke fun at the funnymentalist traders because…..Okay, I poke A LOT of fun at the funnymentalist traders out there because they always talk about the news. How this news made it drop, and how this up and coming news will make it pop. Really, when they talk about the fundamental reasonings behind it, for the most part I cannot disagree provided it isn’t some red neck explanation about how the economy is going to tank because Obama is a socialist.  The pointing being though, I feel sorry for them because they don’t get that the setup for the pop/drop was predestined before we even heard the news. See, funnymental and technical analysis are really two different styles of trading. The problem arises when people who are day trading (or short term trading) think they can use fundamentals to help them with their swings or scalps. When fundamental traders get shaken out by the intraday volatility, not realizing that, for their longer term outlook based on their fundamental analysis, the intraday pop/drops are only noise. For example if you are scalping the $ES_F (S&P500) and you make decisions based on fundamentals, news and economic outlook, you are definitely getting your ass handed to you. 100% you are in the red. As funny as it may seem, you can go into just about any chat room and see people commenting about the news, the government, the earnings, etc etc  on why their trade failed them. The fact of the matter is, the people who are day trading, just don’t know that the basis of their thinking is flawed. The scope of their analysis should be more technical rather than fundamental. 

In a fundamental analysis, you will consider the financial reports of the company, you look for long term profit project, you will consider its leadership and you would like to invest not for quick gains but for longer term profits. You’d like to be like Warren Buffet. Your judgment is based on company’s track record, its financials, its management and its potential to grow. Vocab of fundies: “ Whats the news? Earnings should be positive today. You have huge balls to take a position at the open. The acquisition of ABC inc should cause the stock to split. This is a strong balance sheet in their quarterly report” 

A technical analysis on the other hand requires you to consider the charts. The charts help you identify trends and the momentum. They help you identify levels of supports and resistance. For the day trader, we LOVE volatility! My judgment is based on where the market will move technically, bracketed by the levels that will delimit the extent of the accumulation or distribution. My vocab: “Weeeeeeeeeeee.. GO UP!!!! SMACK HERE!!! POP HERE!!! Weeeeeeeeee. The trend if your friend. Pop it to drop it. This HnS should work out on this divergence. Think we get a pop here LOL. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee” 

There is a distinct difference between the two schools of thought. The ineffective day traders (and short term trader), are those who cant distinguish where to draw the line when making their decisions about the trade. We can point the blame to many people influencing their thinking: the news, their brokers, the guru’s. Inevitably the blame is to the person who placed uneducated barriers that hinder their ability to make sound decisions by accepting “expert” opinions. The fault falls on you. Really as an “investor”, you should not only consider the fundamentals, but you should supplement your decisions with technical analysis. if the market makers want the stock, the market to sell, they will make YOU buy it! Why? it doesn’t make sense for them to sell their positions when the stock is already weak, like YOU the n00b trader would. They would rather sell when the market is going up! So what do they do? They make a distribution pattern and sell heavy at the top.. leaving YOU with the dead weight.  To make the stock or market go up, they will make YOU sell, so they can get out of their short positions at the lows and start buying at the lows. Why? Because its more profitable for them to do that then enter when the market has already popped. Buy low, sell high right?? 

It is NOT random that on Thursday December 27th and Friday December 28th I was able to tell r/investing exactly where the S&P500 was going BEFORE whatever news you want to say took us there. Furthermore, on Sunday night I told r/wallstreetbets in the chat room, that $ES would get a real healthy pop at 1385.. Im not sure if you saw what we did yesterday…Popped from 1384.50 to 1425. I am sharing this because I see far too many “investors” getting burned… how many times have you heard, “ahhhh it hit my stop only to do exactly what I thought it would do”. “or we popped on the unemployment numbers but it got sold because people took profit and I wasn’t quick enough”.. 
Stop taking what the news institutions and self-proclaimed “gurus” say as absolutes.  The move is set up LONG BEFORE the EXCUSES make headlines. 

We peons need to use all the resources available to us. The techs are our friends and I will continue to prove this on r/investing as long as I feel that im getting through to a few people with open minds. 
So many people here claim they are INVESTORS but they get so worked up about the intraday moves. Fundamentals will work with your long term strategy but if you are trying to get rich quick off fundamentals, YOU are in for a rough ride, my friend. 

Be open to learning more about the techs. We both know you are open to hear whatever CNBC and Cramer tell you. 

Happy 2013.

2013-04-08 21:19:06,Sell Walgreens. DEA is about to hammer them. Learned this from my visit to a dozen locations today.,"Below is the full text of something I plan to post in several subreddits.

The gist is this: According to two pharmacists I have long relationships with, Walgreens entire chain underwent an audit by DEA that finished in the last two weeks. It was a very bad result. Walgreens employees and pharmacists in Florida have told me directly: Walgreens is about to get mowed down by DEA over allegations of distributing too many schedule II drugs of all types. Not just the notorious oxycodone, but every drug in that class. They have received their last shipments, are mostly out of supply again, and expect to NEVER receive more.

As below: I am a chronic pain (legitimate) patient who has been through hell and terrible pain.

I am not a Walgreens investor or employee, only a customer. Thank God I am not an investor. If I were, I would be selling every share as soon as the markets open.

If anyone wants real proof that I am a real person, and store details, feel free to PM me. I will not share individual employee names. These people are ""friends"" of mine, in the sense that I have known them for years and they have offered sound advice. I believe them all to be very good, but very afraid of DEA.

Godspeed.





DEA has decided I am not in ""enough"" pain.

Today my wife and I visited 17 different local pharmacies, attempting to refill my prescriptions for pain medication. We will try again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next. I am not optimistic.

I have had three back surgeries so far, and need at least one more, possibly two. My life is one of brutal pain from waking until sleeping. I have seen the same doctors for six years, and been filling these exact prescriptions during that time at the exact same Walgreens and CVS stores. I know and am friendly with the staff. My wife carries a complete copy of my medical records. Documenting every surgery, every time needles have been driven into my spine, every procedure. Today, every single pharmacy was united in their message: Your records no longer matter. Yes, the two inch thick pile of records proving I am in severe pain ""no longer counts."" Nor could they tell me what WOULD count, what WOULD make a difference. Because, you see, they did not know either. They were plainly confused and fearful. Some didn't really want to talk about this at all.

Today my pharmacist told me that they would probably never carry any schedule 2 medications again. At Walgreens. At nearly a dozen locations. Forever. Just as frightening, he told me hes not supposed to share this. He was only allowed to hand me a prepared statement from corporate that said ""Due to changing requirements, we will no longer fill your prescription."" No explanation, no method to appeal, nothing more to be done or said. Not even a vague idea provided about how to ""meet"" these nonexistent requirements.

I called Humana, my insurer, about mail order options. They told me that my medication was covered by the plan but that it ""would be illegal for them to allow me to have it."" This defies the most basic ideas of common sense. It verges on parody and is offensively absurd. 

DEA has vilified a legitimate and useful medication that has improved my life and the lives of countless others. It is reprehensible, disgusting, and morally incorrect. Pharmacy personnel are afraid of violating rules which no one has ever clarified. Afraid of being tossed out of a job or into a jail cell.

I use 150 fifteen mg pills per month. Five per day. DEA regularly trumpets headlines like ""We shut down a pharmacy that distributed nearly 200,000 doses of Oxycodone last year."" I hope you understand that means they served about 1,000 people in my level of pain. In a county with nearly 500,000 people, and in a city the size of the Bay Area, these numbers seem perfectly reasonable to me.

I am keenly aware of the illicit trade as well, and am hopeful that it is improving. However, those of us in real pain are being forgotten, left behind in a DEA witch hunt that will only hurt all of us. And seems to have no safety net for those in true need.

Meanwhile, people in genuine pain suffer. Like me.

2013-04-21 21:14:25,Just bought 30 shares of FB...here's why,"I know most of you will call me foolish, but I really believe that FB is a buy right now.

1) Announcement of the Facebook Home phone generated a good amount of enthusiasm for the stock (despite some haters). The whole idea of a Facebook centralized phone is a pretty good move because this will help solidify facebook's presence in the mobile market (they're already dominating it).

2) General Motors (GM) just signed their first advertising deal with facebook. If this proves fruitful for GM, this would open the floodgates for many other big corporations to pay for advertising slots

3) If the facebook phone ends up being something people like, I could see Facebook start to eat into the profits of mobile companies AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc...Facebook could theoretically destroy the SMS message by having people text (hopefully even call) via the facebook service. 

4) Facebook Graph search has some potential. If facebook can force its users to stay within facebook for searching (not using google or anything else), this would generate even more revenue for the company. 

5) I can definitely start to see companies using the ""Promote"" feature for facebook. By paying 6.99, you can promote your posts so all your friends will see it (more frequently too). Think of the budding CEO who wants to get his product out there to more people...think of the budding musician who wants people to start hearing his music...The list goes on..


If Facebook can accomplish these tasks efficiently, I say they are on their way to becoming a big threat for not just the mobile market, but the advertising market. Facebook could theoretically open up a whole new world for advertising like nothing we've seen before. 

Of course this will be difficult...However, in my opinion, they are poised to do so - Zuckerberg is a smart dude. He doesn't care about the money - he's all about social change.

2013-06-13 23:23:36,"By request: Why Bitcoin is a specific kind of scam called a seigniorage scheme (long, but has tl;dr). X-Post from /r/Finance.","Seigniorage has two functional definitions, although they really dovetail out of one. Within debt-backed fiat it's usually defined as the profit made from interest paid on the debt which backs the fiat. The persons with seigniorage privilege in debt-backed fiat would be the cartel of international banking elite to whom once-sovereign nations pay the interest to lease their non-sovereign ""sovereign"" currencies.

The strict definition of seigniorage, however, is 'the difference between the face value of something and the cost to produce and distribute it.' In the case of debt-backed fiat, the interest is rolled in as a functional increase in the value of the currency to the seignoirage privilege holders, since it's additional revenue generated from the same dollar despite no additional cost being required to produce the physical bill or digital dollar entry on a balance sheet. In the case of coinage, the inheritor of seigniorage is the United States treasury (say a quarter costs $.03 to produce and bring to market, and its face value is $.25. The inheritors of the seigniorage profit $.22 per quarter when they are initially spent into the market).

Bitcoin is a seigniorage scheme because the program was not widely known or public when the first bitcoins were generated. You can show me your fancy bs (and it's really just window dressing, making things appear fantastic so you will be distracted from the same rotten core that's at the center of all such scams) about 'mining' them and how it's 'free to all' and all of this, but the fact remains that whether they were 'mined' or not initially, at the beginning there was a very small group of people who knew of the existence of Bitcoin. An anonymous, shadowy cartel of insiders who pretends to be one fictitious person in order to maintain their anonymity.

Because Bitcoins are digital, the cost of generating them was negligible, as was their value. Their value was then pumped artificially using paid gophers and an enormous marketing campaign throughout internet circles, preying upon lonely techies with decent job security and convincing them it was a gateway to 'economic freedom.' This is textbook scam; it has a vulnerable, wealthy, lonely market audience with very little practical experience with economic models or systems, but plenty of money to take.

The creators of the initial currency and system are unknown, which means the inheritors of the seigniorage are totally anonymous and to this day no one knows who they are and what they've done with the massive amount of money they've earned when they sold their once-worthless but post-pump-valuable Bitcoins onto the market initially. This is textbook scam, it should be a huge red flag. The fairytale that this is the creation of one person, who obviously does not exist, is another red flag of a textbook scam. When Rome crashes and burns, these insiders simply slip away to their new island in Micronesia while you're dead in the water, and you have no way of even knowing who pantsed you.

Once the value of the commodity was inflated beyond its initial zero value, Bitcoins were then sold liberally to lonely suckers with zero scam experience, at which point the insider cartel could've just walked away and let it crash and burn. Instead, more scarily, it appears they have used part of that capital (and perhaps only sold part of their initial reserve) to exert influence within or over the exchanges themselves, and may control one or more entirely for all we know. The pump then continued. The exchanges are incredibly corrupt, there have been several crashes already and there is zero explanation for how the value of Bitcoins has recovered from any of them. The most likely answer, in my opinion, is that the seigniorage gains and revenues from insider-generated dumps and successive rebuys are being used to continue to pump the scam, as is typical in equity market pump and dumps as well. The insiders are always going to exit before everyone else, allowing them to rebuy on the cheap and pump again, and their control over one or more exchanges facilitates this.

**Then there's the total hogwash that Bitcoin is a 'currency.' There are several reasons why Bitcoin is not a currency, but rather a zero-purpose digital commodity.** This distinction is very important, because removing its distinction as a currency means its downfall is inevitable since as a digital commodity it has zero tangible purpose. Anything can be a medium of exchange for as long as you can trick one fool into valuing it, but that doesn't make it a currency. It makes it a pet rock, minus the rock and the paint if it's digital.

A key difference between a currency and a commodity is that currencies typically command a premium within poorer societies, and commodities need not. A great example is the Federal Reserve Note (most people mistakenly call it the United States Dollar), which is worth more and generates a great deal of attention if pulled out of a wallet in Zimbabwe. Try that with a Bitcoin, and after the initial curiosity surrounding its novelty you'll be left only with confusion as you utterly fail to explain to these people why this silly token has any value whatsoever.

If you can name one poor society that values Bitcoins more highly than first-world ones, you'll be well on your way to shattering my logic. But you won't be able to do that, because poor societies have zero use for Bitcoin; it is a commodity of privilege because its uses are fictitious, and the fact that it doesn't translate vertically down the income inequality ladder means it is completely screwed in its supposed-intended long-term purpose. This is in marked contrast with, say, silver, which is a true currency (as well as a commodity) in that it has ubiquitous global liquidity and can be exchanged for virtually any world currency within any society, with a linear increasing premium as income within the society of exchange falls.

Bitcoins also have very poor liquidity, in that they are incapable of purchasing most fundamental necessities of life, and certainly cannot do so on demand. The very few exceptions to this are niche cases hoping to benefit from the fad and nothing more. This also makes it dissimilar to currencies, which have peak liquidity.

Magic cards, for instance (interestingly, the thing MtGOX, short for Magic: the Gathering Online Exchange, was initially designed to trade, before they were prohibited from doing so), are an infinitely stronger currency than Bitcoins ever will be because they are incredibly liquid anywhere but indigenous communities (making them weaker than, say, silver or gold but little else), and command a great premium in less-affluent societies like Brazil. They're also a functional on-shore tax shelter, making them one of the most practically useful mediums of exchange in the entire world, and their market has experienced more sustained, successive growth than any in modern history to my knowledge, while remaining nearly crash free.

The most recent seigniorage scheme that Bitcoin resembles is cap-and-trade. Only cap-and-trade was a far more honest scam, in that at least the globalist billionaires like Al Gore were willing to admit they were the team who was going to inherit the seigniorage when companies were forced to purchase a totally worthless and created-from-zero-and-at-zero-cost commodity called 'carbon credits' at an artificially inflated value. When the carbon credit market crashed in Europe and the whole scheme reached seeing-is-believing level, the plan was abandoned (money already made, just like Bitcoin is poised to do/be). Bitcoin is even shadier; the sinister seigniorage schemers won't even admit who they are, and the only difference is that its market hasn't crashed yet. But it will. Guaranteed. Because they're totally worthless.

Don't be a bag holder.

**TL;DR:** A huge quantity of Bitcoins were created by people, at their leisure, when their value was zero and no one knew they existed, then their value was pumped by marketing to a target audience of well-paid, bored, gullible suckers and then they were sold to them at much-higher-than-zero value. The inheritors of the seigniorage are anonymous. Currencies have liquidity, and command a premium in less-affluent societies. Magic cards (intentionally trivial comparison) are a real currency in every single way Bitcoins are not, and will continue to function as a far better alternative currency than Bitcoins ever will, because they're also a functional on-shore tax shelter as well as having peak liquidity and being a way to convert any currency into any other currency without paying conversion fees.

**STL;DR:** Bitcoins are cap-and-trade 2.0, plus anonymity for the perps since they couldn't possibly get the legislative cover Gore et. al tried to obtain so they would be immune to prosecution for scamming everyone when the market inevitably crashed.

2014-01-24 09:36:59,The price of a stock I've bought is dropping. What should I do?,"I bought ANIK several days back for the following reasons:

- superb growth rate
- very good value (PEG<1, ratios are very attractive relative to industry average)
- financials are healthy
- a fellow Redditor introduced me to the CANSLIM system and after reading up on it, I realize that ANIK satisfies almost every single criteria
- I read up on the reports/filings and did some research on the industry and learned that ANIK is the producer of 1 of only 5 hyaluronic acid products in the U.S. Some more research shows that healthcare is a sector that is poised to expand a lot... because of an aging population and so forth.

Considering the above, I've decided it's a worthy investment. I didn't invest a LOT though (only 12 shares) because I'm very new and don't want to risk too much.

Since then, I've lost 5.34% on it. 

Now, prior to investing, I've read a lot, and I know I should have a stop loss point at about -8% (subject to the fluctuation tendencies of individual stocks). The thing is, I've no idea if this is a temporary and very normal correction and I should just ride it out, or if it's a sign of BIG TROUBLE and I should get out ASAP.

If it's a correction and I set a stop loss limit, I risk wiping out my potential profits (and it's especially painful because I didn't pick this stock at random - I actually did a lot of research). If it's NOT a correction, I risk losing a lot without a stop loss limit.

2014-05-22 02:20:40,Bitcoins - All eggs in one basket experiment.,"**Preface:** I am planning on using all leftover funds from my paycheck after rent, living costs, and other expenses to buy bitcoins for 12 months. Essentially, this would be equivalent to being ""paid"" in bitcoin.

Now this is obviously a *very* risky decision, and not suitable for most, but I believe I'm in a situation where the downside is minimal.

I have also followed bitcoin for two years, so I'm not some new bandwagoner. Throughout this time, I have experienced two full bubble cycles and have seen it's acceptance grow very rapidly. I already do hold a good amount of coins.

My current situation:

* 23 years old, single, no loans or debt.
* Take public transit, no funds needed for car, though I do have one.
* 100k salary after bonuses (typical newgrad engineer)
* Contribute as much 401k as company match, but not 17.5k
* Maintain 10k in checking account at all times.

Now in my current situation, I would usually just stick the remaining into Vanguards S&P500 or a bit into individual stocks if I'm feeling lucky.

The most disastrous downside that I foresee is that I'll be a year older, with the same amount of cash in my checking account. Still way ahead of the curve for my age...

So now my question to you guys. What other factors should I take into account? Or maybe convince me why I should not do this investment experiment.

One of the rules that we follow is proper bankroll management. Right now both of our bankrolls are at about 25 thousand dollars and our average buyin for a cash game is 500 dollars. We would have to go on a 50 buyin downswing for us to go broke, so as long as we are playing well our bankrolls will never reach zero.


My question is, over time this 25 thousand dollars is growing by a few hundred dollars per week, but it never earns any interest.

I'm not sure I agree with the notion at all. The tech industry is being compared to the the dot com bubble of 2000. As I see it, that year was different from the present day in two ways -

* overvalued, high premium like Uber, Zynga, and Groupon are bringing about real change in the way we interact with the world around us. This was not true in the epets.com days when money was chasing companies which didn't have an established market. Plenty of us have used Uber, played Farmville, and used a GRPN to buy something. 


* the tech industry has stalwarts like Google, Apple, FB, MSFT, AMZN etc who understand the market. To me, these companies are like the biggest, baddest predators in the jungle - they maintain order by either buying up good ideas or muscling into a promising niche and killing off new competitors.

In fact, we could also argue that the present stock prices of GRPN (~$7) and Zynga (~$2) is an indication that the market if working as intended.

During the dot com days, we didn't have this much depth in our understanding of the market, substantive behavioral change (no one was ordering pet food online,) and there weren't any companies who could clean up after a catastrophic collapse.

My point it that the market may collapse but I don't think it will be because of overvalued tech.",0,30

2014-12-14 02:27:31,I just decentralized the entire $1.4 trillion derivatives market and created a new kind of mathematical object.,"White paper is in progress, but I will summarize the theory here.  I offer it to the internet for free, and only hope that you will use its power responsibly.  Also, I made an error in the topic title... the derivatives market isn't worth 1.4 trillion (ap, you twit).  It's $1.4 quadrillion.  
  
**What I propose is a new kind of asset, a 2-dimensional and n-dimensional bitcoin.  I am calling it a cryptocontract.**  
  
As I listened to speculation about the price of bitcoin on stage at the Dubai Conference, it occurred to me what the next step should be.  
  
Bitcoin binary options recently became a thing (http://btcoracle.com/) but it's not enough.  It's all still centralized.  All trading is.  
  
All trading and asset speculation is conducted through the SEC and other central regulatory agencies.  There's no way to either hedge your risk on a given asset, OR to speculate on a particular asset's price in the future without going through a centrally regulated agency.  
  
**Say hello to crypto-options.**  
  
It's been a while since I've been in computer science (like ten years) so I don't know exactly how this would work, but I do know how it would function.  What you would need is a crypto asset with a public hash that has TWO solutions (or more, but lets start simple).  That way, when that crypto asset is generated (let's call it a cryptocontract for future brevity) it has a hard condition coded into it that will resolve at some point in the future, based on the price of a given asset.  
  
For example, let $condition = ""the price of bitcoin is greater than $1000 on June 1st, 2015"".  
  
Now I know this is problematic on several fronts.  First of all you have to encode date sequencing into the condition, but that could be taken care of via block numbers.  Second, you need to agree on a metric of measure for the value, which I'm not sure how you would hard code into the contract.  
  
**The ultimate goal, of course, is to allow two people to make a bet which neither can back out of.**  
  
------------------------------  
  
Now that the cryptocontract is generated, the public hash that represents it (or is it, again I'm not an expert on this stuff) needs to have TWO solutions or keys.  That way owner 1, who is betting that $condition will be false owns it, and owner 2, who is betting that $condition will be true also owns it.  
  
As the specified block (or date) on the condition approaches, the contract naturally resolves to either true or false.  In other words, just like a real options contract, it becomes either more or less likely to happen.  
  
See where I'm going with this?  **Just like a real options contract, it's not just about the cryptoasset and it's eventual resolution.  The contract itself THEN also has a value and can be traded, sold, and bought.**  
  
Right now if you want to do this, whether it's to wildly gamble or hedge your risk, you have to go through a central agency.  But with my cryptocontract you don't have to.  It's decentralized by design, anonymous so you don't even have to know or trust the person that you are creating the contract with, and resolves automatically so that no one can back out of the bet once made.  
  
Even better, if you later decide that you like the value of your current side of the contract at this moment and don't want to see it through to resolution, you can simply sell it on the open market.  
  
**Here's an important part:**  Once the asset hits its expiration block, it AUTOMATICALLY resolves so that at *that* moment, only one of the private keys becomes valid and the other invalid, based on whether $condition is true.  
    
Once you can create a hash with two private solutions, it should be trivial to create one with multiple solutions, or even one with multiple conditions.  
  
Basically, you can then create a ladder of conditions with multiple owners all owning a slice of that cryptocontract.  As the contract nears resolution and only one of those eventualities becomes true, one owner emerges and resolves at the specified time.  
  
Holy shit, this could even be used for elections and all sorts of other applications.  Imagine an election with perfect transparency, with all voters assigned a way to 'bid' on the outcome of the cryptocontract, with each candidate owning a slice of that contract.  When the contract resolves at 'final' election day, one candidate emerges.  
  
I just decentralized the 1.4 trillion derivatives market **and** solved the transparency problem with democracy, and it's not even noon yet.  If one of you other geniuses makes this real, hit me up on Changetip.  Consider this my first white paper, bitch.  
  
2-dimensional and n-dimensional cryptocoins are a real, mathematical construct.  Because they can exist, they will eventually exist.  And they will be worth trillions of dollars.  The only question is who will create and popularize them first?
  
americanpegasus just changed the world.   Again.   
  
---------------------------  
  
**edit #1 - 0902z - 14/12/14**: I'm just realizing how such an asset would have initial value, and I'm thinking about how it would function.  Would it be a side chain, or built upon the bitcoin block chain?  It would have to be.  Because in order for it to exist, value has to be input into it.  
  
For example, if I offer you such a contract, you have to buy it from me.  The only way to make this happen is in bitcoins.  So how would this work?  Ok, let's let the cryptocontract be represented by the symbol **&**, and this particular contract, ""The price of bitcoins will be greater than $1000 on June 1st, 2015"" be 'b'.  Also, let my stake in the contract be represented by **&b-1** (believing it will happen), and yours represented as **&b-0** (believing it will not happen).    
  
So I am offering **&b-1** for sale.  My price is approximately $350, or 1 bitcoin.  Even if that's not a fair price, let's just assume it is for ease of illustration.  I don't believe it will come true, and if you do, let's dance.    
  
You agree to purchase this asset, and so we have to create it on the network.  To do that we'll need to both pay into a system so that we both have something at stake.  I transfer a bitcoin into **&b**, and so do you.  
  
At this point we both own **&b**, as there are two private keys.  By design, no value can be extracted from **&b** until the target block (resolution date) has passed.  This prevents anyone from backing out of the bet.  And at the target block (which it timed to occur around June 1st, 2015) one of our private keys is destroyed, and only the other remains, effectively granting us access to the 2 bitcoins stored within.  Of course, throughout the contract process, the value of each of our keys fluctuates too.  If it looks increasingly likely that condition will be true, the value of **&b-1** approaches the limit of 2, while **&b-0** approaches zero (worthless).  
  
But this method only allows the issuance of straight bets.  It works as long as all the functions work, but there's a better way, and also the problem of external values still needs to be solved.  
  
I have a long drive home.  I'll keep thinking about this.  Ideas are welcome.  I don't own math; we all do, I just want to help create it.  
  
-----------------------  
  
**edit #2 - 0936z - 14/12/14**:  Shit, what if value didn't NEED to be extracted?  What if bitcoins were destroyed in the process of creating this cryptocontract (**&**)?  Then the contract would by default have the value of 2 bitcoins because that's how much currency was destroyed in the creation of it.  
  
Then no 'extraction of value' is necessary.  The asset (almost like a collectible trading card, but one created by literally burning money) only exists because two people agreed to destroy money to create it.  And eventually, only one of them will own it.  
  
The value of 2 bitcoins in this object is inherent, as long as the faith of the cryptocontract system remains.  
  
**edit 3**:  I figured it out.   I solved the centralization issue.   It obviously can't be based on a USD exchange set value.  It either has to be one of two things.  Either a fluctuating value determined by people's faith  in buying what the contract represents.... or A globally observable and verifiable metric like total hash rate!

We want to invest this into something that will bring decent return and not overly risky. We originally thought about putting 50K in the market into an ETF like SPY. We are all under 30 years old so a little risk wouldn't really bother us but since we have 100K to invest we were wondering what Reddit thought. 

Some additional info:

- 100K to invest

- Group of 4 investors(all under 30)

- Thought about investing from things like the stock market to buying a liquor store or franchise restaurant

- Our skill set: one works as a business analyst for an investment bank, one is in house counsel as a corporate lawyer, one owns a liquor store and the other is in undergrad

- We are willing to use some or all of the capital

- We are not really particular in the actual investment",4,38
2014-12-27 17:09:49,"Longtime bitcoin trader, new to the stock market and have some questions.","I learned most of the trading fundamentals from trading bitcoin for the past two years. I've since divested most of my funds to the stock market, but there are a few questions that I can't quite understand as most of my experience is from trading on bitcoin markets.

* Stock markets have trading hours and are otherwise closed on holidays and after hours. Yet I see after hours trading, and the price still fluctuates. How do people perform after hours trades, and if you can still perform these trades, why isn't the market just considered open?

* Very often I see a stock price close at a certain price, then open the next day with a huge jump or crash. Looking at the daily chart, it seems like the slope of the stock price is infinity during this change. For example if the price closes at $80 and opens the next morning at $60. This obviously never happens in bitcoin as the exchanges are live 24/7. So when the stock market opens at $60, do all the open trades between $60-80 actually execute? If I have a stop loss at $79, will it execute at $79 or will I actually sell at the open price of $60? Alternatively if I have limit orders set up, and it hits my threshold after hours but then falls back below before opening hour, will my trade be executed?

* In bitcoin you have a few different bitcoin exchanges (bitstamp, bitfinex, okcoin, btcchina, etc) that all have different current prices depending on their own bid/ask spread. In the stock market there are different brokerages to execute trades (schwab, etrade, vanguard, etc). Are these two analogies comparable? Or do all these brokerages trade under the same bid/ask price of a stock defined by the NASDAQ or NYSE. Why do we even need brokerages and why can't we just trade directly with the stock exchange?

* While trading stocks, it seems to take 3 days after the trade to settle. I often use funds earned from a trade before they settle on further trades. Is it possible for a settlement to FAIL and what would be the implications if I used funds on a failed settlement?",5,15

Do not assume when it comes to tax advice! To be fair, in this situation he was advised consult an accountant. However, many times people providing tax advice do not.

There should be no tax on this transaction. The estate tax exclusion far exceeds $450,000 and his cost basis in the home will step up to the value at time of inheritance if he gets it appraised.
Unless you are an American CPA, please do not give tax advice online to American residents. It is incredibly reckless and irresponsible. You can ruin financial opportunities and change lives for the worse.
Rule of thumb: if you aren't a CPA, don't run scenarios with assumptions; stick to providing basic things such as tax brackets and capital gains rates.

2015-05-07 11:13:40,Mind The $76 Trillion Global Bond Bubble Even The Experts Are Getting Scared,"Warren Buffett believes “that bonds are very overvalued“, and a recent survey of fund managers found that 80 percent of them are convinced that bonds have become “badly overvalued“.  The most famous bond expert on the planet, Bill Gross, recently confessed that he has a sense that the 35 year bull market in bonds is “ending” and he admitted that he is feeling “great unrest”.  Nobel Prize–winning economist Robert Shiller has added a new chapter to his bestselling book in which he argues that bond prices are “irrationally high”.  The global bond bubble has ballooned to more than 76 trillion dollars, and interest rates have never been lower in modern history.  In fact, 25 percent of all government bonds in Europe actually have a negative rate of return at this point.  There is literally nowhere for the bond market to go except for the other direction, and when this bull market turns into a bear it will create chaos and financial devastation all over the planet.

In a recent piece entitled “A Sense Of Ending“, bond guru Bill Gross admitted that the 35 year bull market in bonds that has made him and those that have invested with him so wealthy is now coming to an end…

Stanley Druckenmiller, George Soros, Ray Dalio, Jeremy Grantham, among others warn investors that our 35 year investment supercycle may be exhausted. They don’t necessarily counsel heading for the hills, or liquidating assets for cash, but they do speak to low future returns and the increasingly fat tail possibilities of a “bang” at some future date. To them, (and myself) the current bull market is not 35 years old, but twice that in human terms. Surely they and other gurus are looking through their research papers to help predict future financial “obits”, although uncertain of the announcement date. Savor this Bull market moment, they seem to be saying in unison. It will not come again for any of us; unrest lies ahead and low asset returns. Perhaps great unrest, if there is a bubble popping.

And the way that he ended his piece sounds rather ominous…

I wish to still be active in say 2020 to see how this ends. As it is, in 2015, I merely have a sense of an ending, a secular bull market ending with a whimper, not a bang. But if so, like death, only the timing is in doubt. Because of this sense, however, I have unrest, increasingly a great unrest. You should as well.

Bill Gross is someone that knows what he is talking about.  I would consider his words very carefully.

Another renowned financial expert, Yale professor Robert Shiller, warned us about the stock bubble in 2000 and about the real estate bubble in 2005.  Now, he is warning about the danger posed by this bond bubble…

In the first edition of his landmark book “Irrational Exuberance,” published in 2000, the Yale professor of economics and 2013 Nobel Laureate presciently warned that stocks looked especially expensive. In the second edition, published in 2005 shortly before the real estate bubble crashed, he added a chapter about real estate valuations. And in the new edition, due out later this month, Shiller adds a fresh chapter called “The Bond Market in Historical Perspective,” in which he worries that bond prices might be irrationally high.

For years, ultra-low interest rates have enabled governments around the world to go on a debt binge unlike anything the world has ever seen.  Showing very little restraint since the last financial crisis, they have piled up debts that are exceedingly dangerous.  If interest rates were to return to historical norms, it would instantly create the greatest government debt crisis in history.

A recent letter from IceCap Asset Management summarized where we basically stand today…

Considering:

1) governments are unable to eliminate deficits

2) global government debt is increasing exponentially

3) 0% interest rates are allowing governments to borrow more to pay off old loans and fund deficits

4) Global growth is declining despite money printing and bailouts And, we’ve saved the latest and greatest fact for last: as stunning as 0% interest rates sound, the mathematically-challenged-fantasyland called Europe has just one upped everyone by introducing NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES.

As of writing, over 25% of all bonds issued by European governments has a guaranteed negative return for investors.

Germany can borrow money for 5 years at an interest rate of NEGATIVE 0.10%. Yes, instead of Germany paying you interest when you lend them money, you have to pay them interest.

These same negative interest rate conditions exist across many of the Eurozone countries, as well as Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland.

Negative interest rates are by nature irrational.

Why in the world would you pay someone to borrow money from you?

It doesn’t make any sense at all, and this irrational state of affairs will not last for too much longer.

At some point, investors are going to come to the realization that the 35 year bull market for bonds is finished, and then there will be a massive rush for the exits.  This rush for the exits will be unlike anything the bond market has ever seen before.  Robert Wenzel of the Economic Policy Journal says that this coming rush for the exits will set off a “death spiral”…

Anyone who holds the view that the Fed will not soon raise interest rates,and soon, fails to understand the nature of the developing crisis. It will be led by a collapse of the bond market.

Market forces, somewhat misleadingly called bond-vigilantes, will lead the charge.

I am not as bearish in the short-term on the stock market. The equity markets will be volatile because of the climb in rates and look scary at times but the death spiral will be in the bond market.

As this death spiral accelerates, we are going to see global interest rates rise dramatically.  And considering the fact that more than 400 trillion dollars in derivatives are directly tied to interest rates, that is a very scary thing.

And in case you are wondering, the stock market will be deeply affected by all of this as well.  I believe that we are going to witness a stock market crash even greater than what we experienced in 2008, and other experts are projecting similar things.  For example, just consider what Marc Faber recently told CNBC…

“For the last two years, I’ve been thinking that U.S. stocks are due for a correction,” Faber said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “But I always say a bubble is a bubble, and if there’s no correction, the market will go up, and one day it will go down, big time.”

“The market is in a position where it’s not just going to be a 10 percent correction. Maybe it first goes up a bit further, but when it comes, it will be 30 percent or 40 percent minimum!” Faber asserted.

Where we are right now is at the end of the party.  There are some that want to keep on dancing to the music for as long as possible, but most can see that things are winding down and people are starting to head for the exits.

The irrational global financial bubble that investors have been enjoying for the past few years has stretched on far longer than it should have.  But that is the way irrational bubbles work – they just keep going even when everyone can see that they have become absolutely absurd.  However, eventually something always comes along and bursts them, and once that happens markets can crash very, very rapidly.

In the pre-crisis days, this would have been mitigated by banks’ willingness to purchase what the ETF providers are looking to sell, but in the post-Dodd-Frank world this isn’t the case so the idea now is that bank credit lines will essentially allow the ETF providers to become their own dealers, meeting redemptions with borrowed cash while warehousing assets and praying waiting for a more opportune time to sell.

- Focus on market cap rather than just share price.

- Stock splitting lowers share prices some companies do it regularly others do not.

- The amount of shares is directly correlated to the share price. More shares dilutes the share price making it lower while the overall value of the company could be much higher than a company with a higher single share price.",53,82
2015-06-15 01:30:39,Is passive investing the new dotcom mania?,"An interesting idea came across my desk this morning. A lot of strategists have been arguing that the US markets are well into bubble territory. It may be so, but where is the exuberance that usually characterises bubbles? 

In 2000, dotcom mania saw day traders churn stocks into the stratosphere. In 2008, speculators surfed the housing bubble inflated by securitised debt. Where is the mania hiding in plain sight now?

Maybe this time, it's passive investing. Investors have poured money in passive funds, taking on the good with the bad, convinced that they can weather any storm to win the investment game. 

Right or wrong, the pattern has a lot in common with the 'buy the future at any cost' logic of tech investors or the 'housing can never lose' calculations that drove securities until they dropped over the edge.

Is passive investing the new dotcom mania?

2015-06-16 15:59:13,Surge in Millionaires in China,"It seems the rise of Asian economies is if anything being under played. For example, riding on the back of a continuing ebullient stock market, the numbers of millionaires in China has gone up by some staggering numbers. Hold your breath:  China recorded 2,378,000 millionaires in 2013, compared to the U.S.’ 7,135,000 millionaires, according to Boston Consulting Group’s 2014 Global Wealth Report. China’s millionaire population shot up in 2014, by 82% from 2012. 

In contrast, the total U. S. millionaires only went up by 18 percent from 2012 to 2013, and a mere 5 percent in 2014. Little wonder then that it is in China that we see the fast-growing financial services sector: more than 4,000 new hedge funds have launched in China in the past three months alone. 

Naturally, hedge funds may look a little different in China; they are not often sold to institutions, but to retail investors through banks and brokerages, frequently with lower minimum investments and lock-ups of maybe a year.

China’s outrageous growth comes alongside a near50% increase in the nation's private financial wealth, covering bank deposits, securities and pension funds but not luxury goods and real estate. BCG assigned the riswe to China’s surge in the “shadow banking” sector, in which credit is swapped through alternative financiers.

China and the Asia-Pacific (ex. Japan) are causing an increase in the total global private financial wealth, despite the U.S. continuing to post high numbers. The region now contains $37 trillion (24%) of the world’s $152 trillion in private wealth.

At current rate of growth, the Asia-Pacific region is predicted to excede Western Europe in 2014 as the world’s second-wealthiest region, trailing behind North America.

Yesterday, I bought some NBG stock, shortly, after the share price fell on bad news concerning the economic status of Greece. Since then, I'm up around 15%. 

If you elect to buy shares in NBG, keep in mind that this is a short term play, not a long term investment. 

Now, if you are going long NBG, you are betting on two things:

1. Greece will get another bailout, and stave off the threat of Euro exit for now. 
2. Tsipras will not nationalize the country's banks. 

No one wants Greece to exit from the Euro. This drama has happened before, and we all know how it turned out - the Greeks got their bailout from the EU to stave off a Grexit. And it will happen again on Sunday. The other European nations are pressuring Germany to stop playing the bad cop and to give the Greek banking system the liquidity it needs for the Greek economy to function. Once a deal is reached, NBG should shoot up anywhere between 50% and 100%.

2015-08-09 21:58:42,My analysis of Apple's potential to add $15 billion a year to its bottom line and transform the toilet paper industry,"I know it sounds crazy but hear me out. This is one of the few industry's ripe for a transformation.

Apple is one of the most vertically integrated companies and in the toilet paper industry, vertical integration makes you or break you. 

So imagine the savings possible by using their expertise in vertical integration to buy forests, lumber yards and toilet paper manufactures. They could transform the toilet paper industry in ways never done before.

**My analysis:**


* 300 million Americans
* say on average people go three times a day, use 12 squares when they go, each square is 3 inches long and each role is 30 feet long. 
* that means they're going through a role about every 3 days or 9 rolls a month
* that also means each month, American use 2.7 billion rolls 
* Assume our goal is 80% market saturation(Apple always dreamsbig), we need 2.1 billions rolls a month. 
* With each tree giving on average 4 rolls a month, we need 2.1 billion / 4 = 525,000,000 trees

Suppose it costs $5 a month for 20 years to care for a tree on average and $10 on average to cut it down. 

So a tree costs Apple $1210 over its 20-year life. 

**We want to figure out if the toilet paper we get from this one tree will make up for its cost:** 

* Assume the tree is an average 1 foot diameter and average 75 feet tall. Ignore the branches. Thus we get (3.14 * 0.5^2) * 75 = 58.87 cubic feet of wood. 
* I do not know how much toilet paper you can get out of a cubic foot of wood. I imagine a lot. Lets say 16 rolls. That means the tree as a whole will give us 58.87 * 16 = 942 rolls of toilet paper. 
* If we sell a pack of 4 rolls for 8 dollars, then this tree will generate (942/4) * 8 = $1884 in revenue per tree over its life
* Thus on average, **each tree will generate $1884 - $1210 = $674 in profit over its life, or about 12 rolls a quarter.**


**Start-up Costs to acquire 525,000,000 trees:**

* There are 4840 square yards in one acre. Assume a tree every square yard.
* So we need 108,470 acres of trees. This sound like a lot but its only 169 square miles. Or a sqaure with sides 13-miles long. It would be super easy to find this land in Alaksa or canada. 
* Say an 1 acre of woods near Portland, Oregon costs $50,000.
* So start-up cost of buying the land at $50,000 an acre would be $5.4 billion. With close to $200 billion in cash reserves, Apple wouldn't even notice it was gone. 
* assuming apple buys all of J&J toilet paper plants for $500 million, so to have resources nessesary to reach 80% market saturation, the total start-up cost would be **$5.9 billion**


**Operating Costs:**

* assume one worker can takes care of 50 acres and each worker earns $20 an hour, and works 20 hours a week
* also assume there are misc costs per acre per quarter of $1000
* that means growing the trees costs Apple ($20 * $20 * 12)/50 + (3 * $1000) = $3096 per acre per quarter
* toilet paper plants - assume they cost an average $50 million a month to operate
* assume misc costs(marketing, salary, rent, utlities, ect) of $200 million a year
* thus there are operating costs of ($50M * 12) + $200M + ($3096 * 4 * 108,470) = **$2.1 billion a year**

**How much revenue can we make?**

* If each tree generates $674 in revenue over its life, that is $33.7 in revenue a year
* if we have 525,000,000 trees, then that is $17.6 billion - $2.1 billion = **$15.5 billion in profit per year!**

Summary

On Monday, August 24th, the Fed injected $18.54 billion from a ""reverse repo fund"" filled with cash accumulated at the end of QE3.

The $18.54 billion was exponentially greater than what has been previously needed to stabilize stock prices.

On Monday & Tuesday, primary dealers failed to move stocks up, because overhead resistance was too strong, and a tactical retreat left the DOW down by a combined 793 points.

On Wednesday, the Fed added $4.446 billion, and combined with a mildly positive durable goods report, the primary dealers succeeded in pushing the DOW upward by an astounding 620 points.

A September rate hike is off the table, but soon the Fed will have to accept a huge drop in stock prices or a return to money printing.

There was a time, pre-2007, when the Fed could move the DOW up or down by 100-200 points merely by injecting or withdrawing a few hundred million dollars. The idea of injecting a whopping $18.54 billion, in one single day, was something that would have been impossible to imagine. Times change...

On Monday, August 24, 2015, the Fed injected more than $18 billion dollars. In spite of that, the DOW dropped by 588 points, and by the end of trading on Tuesday, it was down a combined 793 points for the two days. What I am talking about? I am talking the sudden failure of the traditional methods that the Federal Reserve uses to control the behavior of millions of investors.

How they injected new money into the market, without actually printing any new money yet, requires a discussion of the little known concept of something called ""TOMOs"" and ""REVERSE TOMOs"". At the end of QE3, the Fed collected just over $100 billion of the then-newly-printed dollars into a fund composed of ""REVERSE TOMOs"". As you will see, REVERSE TOMOs work exactly opposite to the manner in which TOMOs work. So, to avoid confusing you, I must get into a discussion of what these two things are.

The Fed has been pushing markets upward by actively printing a lot of money ever since 2001. The first phase of the printing extravaganza was not called ""QE"" because, theoretically, the money that was printed was not permanent. Non-permanent money printing is called a ""temporary open market operation"" a/k/a ""TOMO"" a/k/a ""repo transaction"". ""QE"" is something different. It is officially known as a ""permanent open market operation"" a/k/a ""POMO"". To understand what I am talking about, I have to start talking about an area of finance which is somewhat confusing.

TOMOs, or ""repo loans"" can be thought of as a type of temporary QE. The central bank prints up a quantity of money, usually at the request of its primary dealers, the dealers take the money, and they hand over bonds in return. The money is used for whatever the big banks want to use it for. In practical terms, it is used for influencing stock, bond and commodity price both up and down, depending on Fed policy.

Another transaction, used by the Fed and its dealers is the so-called ""reverse repo"" or ""REVERSE TOMO"". In this type of operation, the central bank hands back the bonds, and the primary dealers hand back the money. The process of using TOMO and REVERSE TOMOs to move prices involves catalysis, rather than brute force. Neither the Federal Reserve, nor any other central banker for that matter, has the resources to fight the entire market.

Careful coordinated use of cash, however, can catalyze changes in market pyschology, and that is often enough to change momentum. The primary dealers use the cash to basically ""paint the tape"", so that patterns are created which provide buy and sell signals to other investors. This allows the Fed to move markets broadly up and down.

Unlike the case with outright QE (POMO's), primary dealers are actually supposed to pay back TOMOs. The repayment myth is why very few people screamed and yelled, between 2001 and 2007, when this method of money printing was the primary one used to fund a rising stock market, and between 2007 and 2009 to slow down the collapse. It was much less controversial than QE because, theoretically, when the money is repaid, it disappears from the system.

Theory, however, often doesn't work in practice, as we'll discuss in a moment. But, before we get into the repayment issue, it is worth a look at how the Fed describes the process:

Among the tools used by the Federal Reserve System to achieve its monetary policy objectives is the temporary addition or subtraction of reserve balances via repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements in the open market. These operations have a short-term, self-reversing effect on bank reserves.

It is hard to remember all the various names for these transactions. Remember, that a ""repurchase agreement"" results in a TOMO, and a ""reverse repurchase agreement"" results in a REVERSE TOMO. The idea that these ""loans"" are ""self-reversing"" is deceptive. It is only true if they are repaid in a timely manner. If not, the end result is the same as outright QE. Between 2001 and 2007, TOMOs and REVERSE TOMOs were used as a primary method of pushing markets up and down.

As you may note from the quote, the Fed alleges that the loans are ""overnight"", implying they are paid back the next day. That cannot be further from the truth. Almost every morning, going back several decades, the Fed has kept itself very busy, by making new ""loans"" as great or greater than the ones before. The primary dealers repay the first ""loan"" with the second, the second with the third, and so on and so forth.

The bottom line is that the Federal Reserve does not get paid back for these allegedly ""overnight"" loans on the next day. Instead, they get renewed by the issuance of new loans, day after day, week after week, and month by month. That way, the dealers can carry out Fed policy until they can finally make money off the money by pressuring markets in the desired direction.

The Fed balance sheet shows an ever-growing balance of repo ""loans"" given out between 2001 and 2009. Eventually, they amounted to a running balance of hundreds of billions of dollars, constantly rolled over at maturity for almost a decade. It was essentially a Ponzi scheme, except that the central bank was running it, so it could never break down. Instead, it facilitated an endless expansion of the money supply. This manifested mainly in asset inflation, but was also paid for by commodity inflation during the first decade of the 21st century.

According to the Federal Reserve website:

The Fed uses repurchase agreements, also called ""RPs"" or ""repos"", to make collateralized loans to primary dealers. In a reverse repo or ""RRP"", the Fed borrows money from primary dealers. The typical term of these operations is overnight, but the Fed can conduct these operations with terms out to 65 business days.

Remember, repurchase agreements are TOMOs. ""Collateralized"" is a fancy way of saying that bonds are posted before the Fed gives out the cash. On maturity, the dealers are theoretically supposed to take their bonds back. But, between 2001 and 2009, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet showed an ever-ballooning mass of repo loans. The loans were never paid back. They were simply renewed, over and over and over again.

The running total of hundreds of billions in repo loans was finally repaid ONLY when the primary dealers received newly printed cash when the Fed started admitted to doing permanent cash printing (""QE""). This gradual process began in March 2009. You can review the entire history of the Fed's repo injections, a/k/a ""temporary open market operations"" a/k/a ""TOMOs"" here.

When you compare each TOMO to the movement of the DOW, S&P500 and NASDAQ, you will find a very strong correlation between large cash TOMO injections and ""up"" days. The ""T"" in TOMO stands for temporary, even though the loans are more or less permanent gifts. As with POMOs (QE), money is printed, and, as with POMOs (QE) there is an excellent correlation between injection of cash and a rise in stock and bond prices. The correlation is not perfect, of course, because other factors, like a fantastic news day, can offset the need to inject new money, or even allow some to be taken out.

Once QE began, the TOMO process became irrelevant, and was eventually phased out, because the primary dealers no longer needed them. The process of open and obvious money printing provided them with a permanent source of ready cash, and a market for bonds that could not be profitably sold into the free market. The primary dealers have been very successful in using both the TOMOs and the POMOs to catalyze upward movement in stock and bond markets.

In light of that success, retail investors returned to the market, en masse, during the last phase of QE3. In the midst of that euphoria, not all the printed money needed to be injected right away, and the Fed did some REVERSE TOMOs, holding back some of the newly printed QE money, putting together a sort of emergency reserve fund. Remember, REVERSE TOMOs are the opposite of TOMOs. Money was printed in the POMO (QE) process, and then, because it wasn't needed immediately, it was taken back in the REVERSE TOMO process.

In the end, a fund was created that is essentially a collection of surplus cash, left over from QE3. The existence of this pool of money has allowed the Fed to operate in markets, over the last year, injecting and remove liquidity, without being accused of money printing. Remember, in a TOMO, the Fed takes in bonds and gives out cash. In a REVERSE TOMO, it takes in cash and gives out bonds. Again, if you look at the history, on the days the Fed was accumulating the reverse repo cash fund, stocks mostly went down. Whenever the Fed releases cash from the fund, stocks mostly go up or stabilize if they are going sharply down.

The ""REVERSE TOMO RESERVE FUND"", as I will call it, is a running balance of REVERSE TOMOs, amounting to somewhere between $65 and $120 billion dollars depending on the day. Remember, the fund is composed of REVERSE TOMOs, not TOMOs. Therefore, when the size of the fund goes down, it means that the Fed has injected cash into the system. Similarly, when the size of the fund increases, it means the Fed has taken cash out.

When you look at the numbers, remember one critical point. REVERSE TOMOs operate in exactly the opposite way the TOMOs did during the period 2001 to 2007. The fund that is being deployed is not made up of newly printed cash. It is made up of excess money that was printed up at the end of QE3 but not used back then. The Fed reacts to falling markets by releasing cash from the fund.

Take a look at the history and you'll quickly discover that stock prices rise when cash is released (the REVERSE TOMO dollar amount will fall as a result) and stock prices fall when cash is taken back into the fund (the REVERSE TOMO dollar amount will rise when cash is taken back). The end result has been to stabilize the stock market at approximately the same level as a year ago. This convinced the average Joe Investor that the good times are here to stay.

Unfortunately, times change. There has never been a successful centrally planned economy in the history of the world. It didn't work for the old Soviet Union, and it won't work for America. The intense effort to micromanage the American economy, undertaken over a period of several decades, is also due to fail. It is only a question of when, not if.

In ""olden times"" (pre-2008), injection in the range of $23 billion would catalyze a massive 2,000 point ""up"" day on the DOW. That's why it was never done. But, now, the Fed is dealing with the implosion of a boom set into motion by a credit bubble it created. It is a whole new ballgame. The dealers and the Federal Reserve, however, seem to have underestimated how much money they needed to reserve, at the end of QE3, in their ""Reverse Repo Reserve Fund"". They also seem to have underestimated the amount of cash it would take to change the market's momentum this past Monday and Tuesday.

In spite of injecting $23 billion, the DOW (NYSEARCA:DIA) still collapsed by 588 points, S&P500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) by 78 points, and the NASDAQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) by 170. It was not a total failure. Not yet. Remember, on Monday, the DOW was down by 1,078 at one point. It closed down only 588 points. It was fascinating to watch the events unfold. In the early morning, stocks plummeted in almost a straight line. Then, as banks anticipated receipt of the cash, typically delivered at 1:15 pm, stocks recovered.

Stocks reached a peak around the exact time the money was delivered by the Fed. But, when the money actually arrived, the ""buyers"" began trying to sell. Closing long positions in an orderly manner is essential for the success of a upwardly bound market manipulation. It could have been done, if the dealers had been able to create such chaos. But, it didn't work. Stocks began to head downward again.

In the first part of the last half hour of trading, the longs (I surmise that they are the primary dealer controlled hedge funds) seemed to make a last-ditch effort to catalyze upward momentum. Yet, in an intensely negative sentiment situation, one must quickly sell long positions, or risk getting stuck with big losses. The buyers seemed to try desperately to cover longs before the end of the trading day.

It didn't work again. Once the longs tried to sell, stocks raced down in the last 10 minutes or so of the trading day. It was fairly obvious on Tuesday, the next day, that the Fed was far from finished. The dealers may have staged a tactical retreat on Monday, but they were armed and ready. The futures market was bid up heavily in the early morning hours, and that the indexes were looking spectacular.

As the cash market began trading, however, sellers took over again. The intensity of the selling ended up foiling the longs. Again, the attempt to catalyze upward market movement failed. The DOW ended up down by 205 points. On Wednesday, with the addition of another $4.446 billion in ammunition from a reduction in the reverse repo fund, they finally found success.

The day started off well, with some good news about durable goods. Then, various voting members of the FOMC began telling the public that a September rate hike was ""less compelling"". The combination of a bit of good news, Fed official jawboning, and with a dollop of extra cash to capitalize on it, the dealers managed to raise the DOW by 619 points.

It will be impossible to maintain this momentum without huge additional cash injections. This is illustrated by the fact that the ISE Sentiment Index, which indicates how many real investors want to buy stocks, printed at a sad 79 at the end of the big rally Wednesday. In other words, the rally was contrived, and additional upward catalysis operations will require larger and larger sums of cash.

All of this leaves the Fed in a pickle. Throwing $23 billion at a falling market, didn't stop the decline of stock prices. If they throw in another $23 billion, every three days, stocks will be suspended for longer, or will fall by a only a mediocre amount. But, this cannot go on forever. The current ""reverse repo fund"" has already been drained down to $68.719 billion. That's only enough for a few more trading days. Once it is drained down to zero, the Fed is out of ammunition.

At the zero point, they will be forced to return to either overt money printing (QE) or the covert money printing (TOMOs that are never paid back). Otherwise, there will be a very large percentage decline in virtually all the indexes. We will see either a Great Depression style stock collapse, or a new money printing program. Since ""QE"" is now a dirty word, they will call it something else. Probably, they will go with the covert TOMO route. In the end, however, it is all the same. They will print money.

Between now and then, you could lose a lot of money. During the period 2001-07, the daily cash TOMO injections typically amounted to only a few hundred million dollars. Now, the injections will have to be exponentially greater. At $20 billion a pop, people will begin to notice, regardless of how covert the Fed tries to behave. The end result will be a loss of confidence in the Federal Reserve.

Money printing, however you call it, has a profound effect on precious metal prices. From 2001 to 2009, for example, when TOMOs were used exclusively, gold more than tripled in response to a substantial increase in the money supply. Later, when the POMOs (QE) began, gold soared to $1,900. Both money printing methods put heavy upward pressure on precious metals prices.

The current administration seems dead set on stopping gold from being a ""canary in the coal mine"" that lets investors know what is really going on. It appears to have taken the role as ""supplier of last resort"" in the gold market. Admittedly, it has thousands of tons of the yellow metal. Theoretically, US-owned gold could feed markets for a long time, filling excess demand, and restraining prices against their natural tendency to rise. But, not even America has unlimited resources.

Filling even the current level of supply deficiency will drain the gold reserve to zero in only a few years. And, with the probable loss in confidence in the Fed, the drain will increase exponentially. The gold reserve might not even last a year after that. It is unlikely that the powers that be, desperate though they may be, will risk everything. They are well aware that gold reserves may be critical in the new monetary world that finally unfolds after this crisis is over.

Precious metals prices will eventually rise dramatically. It is just a question of whether it happens this year or 2-3 years in the future. That's why, right now, buying gold as a long term hedge is your best bet. For those caught still holding stocks, however, the good news is that more cash injections are on the way. It is the only method that the Fed can use to offset the speed by which stocks are falling and it will happen until the Reverse TOMO Reserve Fund is entirely exhausted.

About $68.719 billion remains and it will be used before the Fed considers any more money printing. It is reasonable to expect that a combination of cash injection, jawboning and hyping up of stray pieces of good news will be used, in the near future, to catalyze additional up days. Some of them may be very large as the Fed opts for a ""shock and awe"" campaign. Don't be shocked or awed. Get ready to use the opportunity to sell. The long term future is dismal.

Absent money printing, there will be a very large decline in stock prices. We do not yet know the timing. If the decision is to print more money, as is likely, stocks will rise when looked at in nominal terms. However, the Fed will lose so much credibility that the value of the dollar will be greatly impacted. For that reason, a significant delay in making that decision will probably occur. Stocks must fall first, and the techniques they are now using must be proven to be a definitive failure.

It is prudent to use these artificial rally days to get out before the big decline that spurs the Fed into renewed money printing. Then, you can get back in, or choose an alternative investment that will benefit more from the loss of Federal Reserve credibility.",12,41

Congratulations, if the market crashes and you get in on the low (good luck timing that) then you'll perhaps make a sweet little return on the way back up.

I'm not a bull or bear right now. Honestly this correction (maybe crash, I doubt it, but who really knows) has been reassuring to me. Nothing can go up forever. But I'm also a long term investor with no need for the cash I have invested.

2015-12-04 18:40:42,Maybe oil is all that matters,"I was in high school in the 90s, and when I started driving, gas was $0.78 per gallon where I lived.  At that time, we basically had full employment, robust economic growth, and basically the advent of the consumer electronics market as a driving economic force.  

By the time I was 20, fuel was about $2, the economy entered recession, the .com sector collapsed, and unemployment was on the rise.  

Things didn't get much better for 15 years, through two presidents, a couple of wars, trillions in stimulus spending, job programs, financial regulations, etc., etc., etc.

Even until last year, the unemployment rate largely decreased only because 40% of the population was considered to be out of the labor market, wages were stagnant, growth was very slow.

And, now, oil has crashed again.  Unemployment is down, labor participation is up, growth is stronger, interest rates are increasing, home values are gaining steam, durable goods orders are up...2016 is shaping up to be another 1997.

Occam's razor tells me that the explanation doesn't require complex analysis, but is just that fuel costs are the primary indicator of overall economic health in the U. S. (and, so, the world).  It makes a lot of sense to me, since at $4.00 per gallon of fuel, I was spending nearly $500 per month in fuel for me and my wife, and now we're spending  $200 - I'm not pocketing the $300 savings, I'm buying TVs, going out to dinner, buying appliances, and so on.

Such a massive windfall to consumers and fuel reliant business may add something like $1.5 trillion per year to the economy  (I'm just sort of averaging, here...), that is an amazing level of stimulus, annually.  Even at half that, it's a massive impact.

2015-12-08 00:50:30,Everyone here needs to get familiar with something called Monero and Cryptonote. Even as cryptocurrency moves out of the nerd's basement - the greatest crypto-asset has yet to begin its ascent.,"If you know me, you will know that I have spent years studying and reading about money.  In my stock trading days, I made some good picks and enjoyed the support and arrogance of many members of this community.  But honestly?  I've made the most progress while learning about the *nature* of money itself.  
  
I've spent the last 2+ years reading about cryptocurrencies non-stop.  I also have been pretty dead-on as far as bitcoin adoption in the past few years.  
  
So let me take a moment and tell you that the next 'big' thing may not be bitcoin at all, but it's overlooked (and secretly more attractive sister).  
  
This is a subject that could fill a book but I'll outline several key points to pique your interest in hopes you'll do your own DD.  It's not too hard to actually own Monero, but I'm not here to pump up something I already own - I hope that you will do the research and come to the same conclusion that I have: the ascent of crypto is inevitable, as is the ascent of Monero.  
  
**Critical Point #1:**  The financial sector is rife with talks of the 'blockchain'.  But you simply cannot separate the blockchain from bitcoin, as much as Goldman Sachs and Blythe Masters would like to.  This is the foolish equivalent of Russia claiming they don't like the internet so they are committing themselves to building their *own* internet.  
  
Bitcoin is an open-source network, and with any open-source and decentralized financial network things are proceeding as they should - often chaotic with many surges and crashes on the way to ultimate stability (which occur at a much higher price point than now).  
  
**Critical Point #2**: Bitcoin is remarkable in that it advanced money in a very real way beyond what was currently possible but it is *not* the holy grail of digital money that many computer scientists and economists had dreamed of.  
  
Consider the following chart:  http://postimg.org/image/aqjmkgusp/  
  
- We had decentralized and private money for thousands of years with gold.  
- The 'digital dollar' gave us digital and private money (to some degree - banks and processing institutions still had to track you to process your money).  
- Bitcoin came along gave us digital money that no entity owned for the first time but at a cost: everyone can browse every bitcoin transaction back to the beginning of time.  This is obviously unsuitable as a default behavior of a currency - privacy must be built-in, it cannot be some optional add on feature.  Imagine having to obscure every sensitive credit card transaction you make so that it wouldn't be totally public knowledge.  
- Monero (as the largest and most successful implementation of the Cryptonote protocol) emerged from anonymous sources in 2014.  It is not some stock, or some silly nerd toy.  It is no less than the *holy grail of digital money itself* combining for the first time in human history the elements of digital, decentralized, and private.  
  
How does it do this?  By way of something called ""cryptographic ring signatures"".  You can either trust the egg heads who designed it that it works like magic, or develop the ph.D level mathematical knowledge to verify it yourself.  Either way, know this is likely one of the most sophisticated computational objects our species has ever created.  
  
Not only that but it also improves many fundamental aspects of Bitcoin:  
  
- Not happy that Bitcoin is deflationary?  Monero has a small perpetual tail emission that means that miners will always have more Monero to mine.  (after the initial 18.4 million, approximately 400k per year will be minable in perpetuity)  
- Not happy with the blocksize debates raging across the Bitcoin landscape?  Monero uses a variable size blocksize and a per-kb fee so that those debates will never happen on this blockchain.  
- Worried about total privacy being banned by the law (and more likely the IRS)?  Well Monero has **two** keys.  One is a private key that lets you spend your money, and the other is a view key that lets you (or another trusted party) view your balance without actually giving them access to spend it.  
  
This is not a stock, or a commodity.  This is not some get rich scheme (although many will get rich in the coming years on it).  This is nothing less than the new dominant form of money for our entire global civilization.  
  
And you are one of the very lucky few who just learned about it first.  
  
The future will be filled with anonymous money transactions whizzing through the internet at the speed of light, instantly and with no one's permission.  The fees will be a micro-fraction of what are being paid today, and it will be just like the birth of the internet all over again.  
  
This is the 2020's staring you in the face, folks.  
  
Don't be left behind: Educate yourself.  
  
Yes, Monero are only 30 to 60 cents each at the moment, and yes if they succeed in becoming the dominant private financial network on Earth then that per-unit price will likely go to some absurd number that you wouldn't believe if I told you.  You probably wouldn't have believed that 50 cent bitcoins in 2011 would be worth over $1000 by 2014, but it still happened.  
  
That's not the point though - to create a brand new, decentralized financial network from nothing you have to make a few people rich.  There is no other way to do it.  The point is that the future of finance is in cryptography and blockchains and you need to either understand it or retain the talent that does if you hope to continue to be a relevant player over the next 20 years.  
  
If you have any serious inquiries about Monero or blockchains, I will be happy to answer them here and you are always welcome to join us over on /r/monero for more talk about Cryptonote or our project.  If you were one of the one's who scoffed at Bitcoin (like I did) in 2009 - 2012 even as it began it's meteoric ascent, this is your moment of redemption.  
  
Let's not make the same mistakes.  
  
Thanks for your time.

The Smart Commercial Drones Market is expected to reach $27.1 billion by 2021 from $3.4 billion in 2014, according Wintergreen Research, Inc’s report, “Smart Commercial Drones: Market Shares, Market Strategies, and Market Forecasts, 2015 to 2021.” According to the report, “The commercial grade consumer video drone segment is the largest one in terms of revenue in 2015, and it is expected to lead over the forecast period.”

GoPro founder and CEO Nick Woodman said at the TechCrunch conference in September that the company is planning to launch a drone in the first half of 2016, “development is on track for the first half of 2016. We have some differentiations that are right in the GoPro alley.” Karma is finally coming.

Hollywood is eager to change the way they take aerial shots. Not long ago, they used helicopters (some still do) to shoot from bird’s point-of-view and it costs a lot. Drone makes it all cheaper. Not only cheaper, but also safer and opens more creative ways of shooting a video. In other words, drones can do what helicopters cannot do.

On May 28, GoPro announced at Google’s I/O conference that it will build a 360-degree camera array for stereoscopic spherical videos. With the help of Google Jump, Google’s virtual reality system,  GoPro’s camera array, Odyssey can make videos like this. I believe the Odyssey can be very useful for real estate market. “360-Degree Real Estate Tour – Brought to you by GoPro.”

Oh, did I mention Odyssey has 16 cameras that work together as one? I repeat, 16. Hey GoPro, why don’t you knock out your useless and wasteful $300 million buyback program out of the park? According to its third-quarter SEC filing (10-Q), GoPro stated,

“To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all.”
They spend 345x more on buybacks than they do on research and development. So GoPro, eliminate your worthless buyback program. “Customize” the money into research and development, and acquisitions. Customize the Odyssey. 16 cameras? Really? Reduce the size and improve the quality.

I strongly believe GoPro should acquire a small thermal imaging company. Thermal imaging can be a perfect fit for drones. I suggest GoPro acquires Seek Thermal, designer and manufacturer of high quality thermal imaging products. If GoPro acquires Seek Thermal or a different thermal imaging tech company, they will be able to reach sectors such as firefighting and agriculture. Diversified!

Partnership with Rollei – a German manufacturer of optical instruments and a seller of GoPro compatible accessories – might be helpful.

Another great acquisition can be Vuzix (NASDAQ: VUZI), a Google Glass rival, and a leading developer and supplier of smart glasses and video eyewear products in the consumer enterprise and industrial markets. Vuzix holds over 41 patents and 10 additional patents pending. Market cap. is currently $104.39 million. With $513 million cash on hand, GoPro can afford the acquisition. In January, Vuzix received a $24.8 million investment from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Intel bought preferred stock that is convertible into common shares equivalent to 30% of Vuzix.

In the third-quarter, GoPro’s revenue increased 43% year-over-year (Y/Y) to $400.3 million. On non-GAAP basis, its net income, operating income, and operating expenses increased 103.9% Y/Y, 71.7% Y/Y, and 44.3% Y/Y, respectively. On GAAP basis, it increased 28.58%, 105.36%, and 43.78%, respectively. The growth isn’t bad for a company with a market cap. of $2.49 billion. However, its inventory days increased 80.6% Y/Y from 67.7 to 122.3.

There are buyout rumors and one of the potential suitors being Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). While this is a great news, it is not likely to happen in the first half of 2016. I believe the management of GoPro would not want to sell the company until they see the outcome of Karma. If the outcome is positive, the company will not be sold next year. If it is negative, the company will be sold unless they have something up in their sleeves. Management’s actions should a sign of what’s to come.

I’m confident the founder of GoPro will turn things around next year. GoPro can be a leader in its field if it eliminates the buyback program and invests into the future. According to Futuresource Consulting, the global action camera market grew by 44% Y/Y in 2014. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.2% between 2014 and 2019. GoPro should target not only sport enthusiasts, but the film and television industry, real estate, and other sectors such as, firefighting and agriculture. In order to do that, GoPro should first create a product that suits the sector’s needs. First impressions are important.

2016-01-06 08:16:45,Another 1-2% off today!,"The market is still over priced but it's nice to see the beginnings of a correction. I look at stock prices and every large cap that has dividends is priced at 20-25 P/E which is ridiculous. MSFT at 37 P/E??? What? Disney at 20+ with ESPN in the tank? No thanks. 

Commodities have tanked and money has flowed out of there into  non commodity names but even those are showing signs of weakness now. Q4 earnings will disappoint and then watch out for those high flying 2015 stocks that dont have any basis for their valuations. NFLX is a $40 stock, AMZN is at best $200-$300, CMG  should fall back into the 200s sooner than the others. 

There are great companies out there and some I've already mentioned but the pricing is way out of whack. Paying a 29 P/E for PG? How is that a good value and how do you expect to make money if you pay that sort of valuation for mature companies? VFC at 25.5 P/E? Where's the earnings growth going to have to be to support that kind of valuation and where will the market take these companies once the slowdown of the commodity sector and the overseas hits consumer spending. 

Just look at SWHC as confirmation of the market searching for anything to make money - up a ton in weeks based on simple higher earnings guidance and fear about gun control. The same thing happened in 2007 right before the 2008 crash where people were searching for potential value ANYWHERE cause everything else was over priced. It's not going to be quite as bad but it's certainly needed.

Cyclicals are the top of their cycle and the roller coaster is about to come down for a while. 

All aboard the cash train to keep some money on the side for when stocks are priced normally again but it'll take a 20-30% drop from current prices to make that happen for even the biggest and safest of names - not to mention the stock darlings whose valuations have no basis in reality. 

For us long term investors - this is a good thing - we're buying for 20 years out so we want prices to correct sooner than later so we don't have to pay outrageous valuations for years.

For short term traders - volatility is gonna be huge this year - big drops and then big short term corrections will be there but overall - the market needs that longer term correction to get values to reasonable levels. 

If you know anything about the market, you know that KO at 27 P/E, PEP at a P/E of 29.5! and MCD at 26 P/E makes no sense to buy. Great companies, awful prices. ",1,18
2016-01-06 11:58:30,Full Time Student: Outperformed the S&P 500 & Passively Earned Some Money. I Learned A Few Things,"To preface, I am posting because I enjoy talking about money, and if in doing so, if it helps you, then it was worth it. Although I've helped some friends through college take control of their finances, have read books, and have some knowledge & experience to know what I'm talking about, I'm by no means making a claim to be a professional. There are plenty of very smart & knowledgeable on this sub-reddit who I can continue to learn from. 



I’ve noticed that a large source of confusion that some people have is buried in a pile of bullshit and web of misinformation when it comes to the topic of money. At the same time, I have found that there is a plethora of information that is of immense value, such as this sub & online resources related to finance. The challenge that I've faced is sort through the crap, and finding out what works for ME. What works for me, will probably not work for YOU...but it might help you to see from a different perspective. 




First, [here is a photo of my brokerage account](http://imgur.com/nV69afd) performance (green line) vs the S&P500 (blue line)



I started the year trading with a total sum around $20,000. In a year's worth of time, I doubled that amount by trading both stocks and options. 


Some might argue that it was just $20k, which is not as big a deal as when trading with $100k. Others might say that it was a lucky year, don’t let it get to your head. Think what you would like, but in my book, it sure beats having money rot in the bank. 



I was able to achieve these results by following market trends, blocking out noise, doing research, and utilizing derivative strategies combined with residual income positions when in cash. As my account grew during the year, I was able to take on more risk and shorten the holding duration of certain positions. And, It wasn’t just luck, as I did take on losses. What really helped was the discipline that I applied in taking many small wins. 




Here are some things that I learned:

-Discipline is money's pimp. If you practice exceptional discipline, you'll have more money that never sleeps. 

-Always have a plan, without it, your emotions will interfere. You will learn from your mistakes. 

-Leverage is an exceptionally powerful tool when paired with discipline. 

-It's a zero sum game, for every winner there will be a loser. 

-Education is key, you must continuously striving to learn more, even if it's in a completely different direction. 

-Listen to what people have to say, but apply your own judgement and do your homework. 

-You don't know what you don't know, so finding a mentor will accelerate your learning curve. 

-Consistency is key. If you can bring in small gains with reasonably controlled risk, over time it adds up. 

-Never think you know it all. 



Time it took:
Being a full time student, this number fluctuated depending on what was going on. I would average about 8 hours per week, this included research time, checking the markets, and reading. Since this is something I am passionate about, this was something I enjoyed spending my time on. 



Risk management:
Different people have different objectives and appetites for risk. For me, my account goal was to end the year above 8%, which I accomplished by limiting my losses, and having many small wins. Steep drops on the graph can be attributed to either poor discipline, or taking on greater levels of risk due to having more money on hand. 


YEAR 2016:
This year my goal is to again be above 8%. However, it will be interesting to see where this year takes us. 






Moving on to my bonus story of earning $3,952 passively while doing some good. Here is a screenshot of these earnings as [proof](http://imgur.com/gallery/NaVj7uj/new)




Those of you who are already familiar with [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/s2/6edbaceac4)
 will recognize where this is from. For those of you who have never heard of Fiverr, it's an online platform that allows individuals to offer various freelance gigs starting at $5. I am a huge fan of Fiverr, as it is easy to setup, reach buyers & sellers quickly, and find a bunch of really talented people who are a pleasure to work with (when you find the right people). I was introduced to the platform as a buyer, but later decided to give selling a shot. Long story short, I found my niche gig (marketing related), slowly became bombarded with orders, found a hardworking English speaking couple in Venezuela that made ~$70 per month working full time jobs (crazy, current price of oil is going to make the situation over there even worse), trained them, outsourced all orders, handled customer interactions & quality control, and split my profits. Was an awesome experience to learn about other people's lives, have some impact on their quality of life, and make some passive income to help max out my retirement account in the process. 





Thanks for reading, feel free to ask any question that you may have, offer your own insights, or PM me.  I'll crank out any responses in a timely manner, I enjoy talking about anything involving money.   ",0,8

2016-01-10 23:13:30,Stock market poised for big Monday action!,"On Friday the VIX (volatility index) reached its highest point since September 2015. It was 27 on Friday. However it reached as high as 40.74 back in August of 2015. 

Worries about the Chinese stock market, Apples iPad sales decline, weather and lower gas prices propelled this 7 3/4% decline. Seems like an over reaction. China has a small impact on the US. IPad sales? No biggie. Lower gas prices are bad for oil companies but good for others. Obviously it puts more money into the pockets of consumers. Other companies in the S&P will obviously benefit. 

The S&P still has to close down more than 2% to drop below the Sept 28 low. For now this 2016 drop is still within a safe technical range. If the S&P doesn't breach the $1881.77 mark then a nice bounce upward seems due. The Friday close may have been your best entry point. Otherwise Monday just might be a great entry point if you're a market timer looking for a quick 5% gain. ",6,31

2016-02-01 00:44:56,"Investment Idea: UWTI - currently $2.50, guaranteed to revert to 'geomean' ($9).","In all seriousness, I think UWTI is one of the safest bets available right now. Take a look at this chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4WBMh8eI/

This is my analysis of a bunch of paired leveraged ETFs. The top part of the chart shows the divergence between the bull and bear ETFs (represents the opportunity potential). Crude oil (the thick dark line) is by far the most extreme divergence right now, which means it has the best opportunity.

The bottom of the chart shows the bullish ETF in blue, the bearish ETF in red, and the Geometric Mean (geomean) of the two in black. In the long run, the geomean always trends downwards (caused by daily-reset slippage), and both red and blue always intersect at the geomean. In the long run, both ETFs are *guaranteed* to revert back to the geomean.

The UWTI/DWTI geomean is currently around $19, while UWTI is at $2.5. Worst case scenario, if oil waited two whole years before rallying, the geomean could get as low as $9. Therefore, worst-case scenario returns are $9/2.5 = 260% ROI.

Note that the price will probably go lower before it goes higher. So, there could be significant (50%+) draw-down in the mid-term. But as long as you just hold the position, UWTI is guaranteed to eventually revert back to its geomean, currently around $19 and likely to stay above $9 for the next 2 years. As long as you can just hang on to the position, you'll be sure to profit. Just don't use any leverage (so you don't get kicked out) and you'll be fine.

So, to summarize, if you have money that you don't need to use for 2 years, put it into UWTI and just wait for it to hit the geomean ($9 or higher).

By the way, the formula for the geomean line is:  (UWTI * DWTI) ^ 0.5

Let me know what you think about this idea, or if you have any questions.

EDIT:  Please notice that I am not talking about ""reversion to a moving average"" or other such ideas. I am pointing out a mathematical property unique to paired leveraged ETFs.

FINAL EDIT:  Now I see the logical flaw in this investment idea:  If UWTI or DWTI have a stock split, it will affect the position of the geomean.  Therefore, today's geomean has no predictive value, even though historical charts seem to imply that it does (a type of survivorship bias).  Thanks for the discussion, guys!",0,22

Now find out what's next, from the master himself.","Everyone knows I am one of the greatest oracles of the modern day.  How I have not been scooped up by some forward-thinking banking think-tank is a cosmic mystery.  
  
Consider I have given /r/investing such stocks as Netflix, Michael Kors, and 3D Systems before any of their monster runs back in 2012.  
  
Then, since early last year I've been warning that we have reached peak market conditions:  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2onv3v/and_then_the_tech_bubble_20_crashed/?  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34axx6/today_a_coworker_struck_up_a_conversation_about/  
  
This subreddit scoffed and continues to scoff at my legendary prowess, but I don't mind.  In fact, last May I told you all that Bitcoin's return over the next 12 months would more than *double* the best performing Vanguard index fund, and **it certainly has**, soaring from $230 to $370.  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34hxdn/the_pegasus_vanguard_vs_bitcoin_challenge_put/?  
  
If that's not enough, I also warned you about the continuing spread of negative interest rates, which are still getting worse by the day:  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3o3dun/three_month_treasury_yields_are_at_zero_percent/?  
  
-------  
  
So, many of you (including top investment professionals at major firms) are probably wondering: ""Pegasus, *wow*!  What's next?""  
  
Well, I'll tell you again, like I always do.  2016 is going to be a crazy year folks; you better buckle up.  
  
**This market isn't going back up until it goes down a lot more!**  
  
I'm calling for a major crash to really punctuate this recent spiral, and I mean something nasty.  I'm expecting a spring time frame, probably in March (yes, as in next month!)  
  
Oil isn't going anywhere.  Expect capitulation to occur as we finally hit $17 a barrel, and possibly lower.  Only then will we go back up, and even then it will take a while to recover.  Bottom line: people trying to catch the falling knife in oil are gonna get burned.  
  
I expect talk of QE4 to begin after the crash though, and it won't be able to come soon enough!  Without QE4 we may see a bottom of 1100 in the S&P by this time next year.  With Q&E?  Well I can't foresee how much magical pretend money the government will print into the stock market, but the reckoning we will face will be the same.     
   
It's simple math: hard assets are going to be precious luxuries soon.  The paper gold market is in for an upheaval as we collectively discover that paper gold is currently a major sham, but the world isn't going back to precious metals... No, the way forward isn't shiny rocks but decentralized digital networks.  
  
This R3 thing the banks are working on?  Because they have so fundamentally misunderstood what a decentralized blockchain is, it will falter and fail.  The banks will use it, of course, in order to try to justify the millions they will spend making it.  But they will eventually abandon it in favor of a true decentralized alternative.  
  
Speaking of which, for a year now I've been intrigued and 'infiltrating' the world of new *private* digital financial networks.  These use protocol level cryptography for financial privacy.  Along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Monero and Aeon are likely to become very big deals in coming years (but I am invested in them, and represent them, so don't take my word for it - check out the cutting edge Cryptonote protocol they are based off of).   
  
The stock market isn't going to implode forever, and I expect a new mega bull run to kick off before 2020, but it's not going to start without some pain first.   
  
Money itself is going to experience it's 'uber moment' and we may even begin to see regulated crypto-securities.  If R3 ever finds a real world niche, it could potentially be here, but I still wouldn't bet on it.  
  
Anyhow, I wouldn't be fucking with anyone at the moment, especially not the 50 - 200 P/E companies that boast 'lots of users'.  You thought LinkedIn's mega crash was news?  More are coming.  
  
You'll know when this tech 2.0 bubble has fully crashed back to Earth because we will be considering the long term viability of even juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon.  And here's where you buy back in.  
  
It's easier said than done now, because when the time comes to buy back in we may truly be in the throes of a major economic crisis.  People will scoff at owning Facebook, Google, or Apple stock but that is where you must go.  
  
The big winners in the next bull run?  The sci-fi tech of tomorrow: virtual reality, self-driving cars, digital money, 3D printing, and AI.  
  
Anyway, I've said enough.  I'm happy to see this crash finally get underway because I know that on the other side of every crash lies opportunity - I just would caution against trying to catch this one on the way down.

2016-02-10 23:03:53,Can't wait until the Bernie Sanders fans find out the fed is paying money to the big banks.,"Since they can't manipulate excess reserves anymore (because there is too much in the system), the fed literally has to pay the big banks on their excess reserves. It's been happening for a while, but at 25 bps it wasn't that much money and not many people noticed. Now that they have started to raise short term interest rates, by offering a higher rate on excess reserves... the amount they pay could start getting up into the tens of billions. I joked with a coworker a couple months ago about how politicians will love this, and sure enough in Yellen's testimony today we saw those pesky politicians start to grill her for it.

2016-02-14 05:01:29,I just put my inheritance into a medical marijuana stock.,"a relative recently died and left me $30,000, and I decided to make an all or nothing bet on one industry.

since marijuana is on the cusp of being legalized in Canada, I figured that the price of their medical marijuana stocks will literally explode once legalization occurs, as the licensed medical suppliers will be the ones most likely to offer recreational weed once it is legalized and regulated. it is projected to be a 5 billion a year industry in Canada.

I bought $29,000 worth of Canopy Growth Corp/Tweed (CGC.V) on Friday after I saw the snoop dogg deal... as tweed is the largest medical marijuana company by market cap, and I have read nothing but good things on how the company is run.

then to be even more speculative I bought $1000 of cannabix tech stock (CSE: BLO, US OTC: BLOZF), who are working on a pot breathalyzer for law enforcement. you can be sure that if they can make a product that works that police all over the world will buy it.
there is just so much room for this industry to grow that I really feel that I am investing on the ground floor. the market right now is an $80 mil a year industry with 30,000 patients enrolled in the health Canada medical marijuana program.

tweed seems like the best positioned company to take advantage of legalization, and at a current share price of $2.72 the increase from an $80 million a year industry to 5 billion would be an increase of 6300%... which would make this the best investment since Bitcoin as far as appreciation goes. so tweeds stock would be worth $174 assuming they had 100% market share... they currently have 25% market share, so that would be a share price of $43.... an increase of 1750%

keep in mind that regulation is happening in Canada, the new government has said that they plan on legalizing it soon, so it's really just a matter of when not if that this stock explodes.

First, many people think another crash is coming. Ill be the first to admit I don't know much about the stock market. But I have read many books on the underlying reasons for the 2008 crash and it seems to me that we haven't fixed any of these problems. It really seems reasonable to me that another huge crash is coming.

If you accept this hypothesis, my question is: why not just short the stock market and just keep hanging on even if it goes up? Then the day it crashes, close all positions? In my naive way of thinking this seems like almost a guaranteed way to make money? This may seem stupid to most of you, but please ELI5 why.

In each of three decades from 1970 through 2000, growth of real gross domestic product exceeded 3% a year. Since 2000, however, growth has slowed to 1.7%-1.8% per year, dismal rates that apply whether we look at 2000-2008 or 2000-2013 or 2000-2015.

> [The Fraser Institute’s economic freedom index for the U.S. has had a similar trajectory. The index—which tracks the degree to which free-market capitalism is allowed to operate—rose every decade from 1970 to 2000, which coincided with the extended period of relatively strong growth. Since 2000, however, the index has fallen, coinciding with the period of relatively weak growth.](http://www.barrons.com/articles/the-real-reason-behind-slowing-u-s-growth-1457760081)

I hope you guys are doing well in your trading. In case you remember I was the guy who made that post over a month ago right at the $26.20 oil bottom calling it the bottom. Thanks for all the commentary and discussion in that thread... it was awesome!

I have another one for you guys. Today's writeup comes in video form [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS5JZDeMk0Q). It's 10 minutes long, and it will in detail go over some of the psychology and possible moves in the market moving forward. EDIT: (I am a bear and am not a bull in this market, this is a video to show you that it's NOT a bull market just because of this recent rally) 

So the major question is...is this the beginning of a bull market, or the start of a bear market? Either case surprisingly starts off exactly the same as what we saw over the last 6 months. It's possible that it will not be clear that it's a bull market until later this year (could be as late as August)... and it will not be clear it's a bear market until likely the summer as well.

So if you plan to trade this year hopefully this can help get you out of a jam... or at least give you some insight into timing your trades and not being the last person in on the trade. 

Choppy waters ahead... Thanks everyone!

Let me introduce myself. I'm a professional day trader of eight years experience. I also have an algorithmic trading platform which I programmed myself. Market and fundamentals are my life--but also so are technical's. 

I made [this post here on /r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/45336n/oil_why_i_believe_this_is_the_bottom_and_if_it/) calling out the oil bottom a day ahead of that bottom ;) so I'm now coming back with my second prediction. This market is going to fall. Or maybe not, what do I know. I'm just some guy from the Internet. 

[Video here](http://youtu.be/IS5JZDeMk0Q) I called it ""The Anatomy of a Bull Market"" to show that in my opinion what's setting up now **isn't** a bull market. There are not only key fundamental bearish notes spread along the entire spectrum (bad debt, chapter 11's, credit downgrades, junk bond selloffs), but the technical's are showing that people don't trust this uptrend either as we're finding lower lows in the SPX and less higher highs over the last year.

The video compares a previous bull market setup with today's market setup and highlights the major differences. Let me know what you guys think, agree or disagree? Tell me why! Let's discuss.

2016-05-06 20:45:44,"I know I'm not supposed to make a post asking for advice, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime situation and I really don't want to blow it.","Hi everyone,

Long-time lurker, infrequent poster. I'm writing this from a throwaway, of course. I've seen, first-hand, a huge amount of helpful advice dispensed on this sub over the last few years. I'd be SO appreciative if anyone would be willing to throw some my way, because I don't really have anyone in my life with whom I can discuss my financial situation. 

I'm 26 years old, living in NYC. I have a freelance job doing digital marketing for a Fortune 100 company. The company that employs me has the contract for another 5 years. I'll make anywhere from $80-100k per year, possibly more as time passes (assuming I keep the job). As of last week, I had about $180k in liquid assets.

Last week, a wealthy family member gave me a $500k loan, to be paid back interest-free in five years. I didn't ask for this loan - it was offered to me on a whim. I'm an amateur investor. I first read ""Beating the Street"" when I was 12 years old, and have been pretty active in the market ever since. My passion for investing is well known, and I hope to one day soon be able to focus on investing full-time. Over the last ten years, I've primarily been on getting my life off the ground, as most of us have to do, but I think it's finally time to turn the corner. 

I know that so far, this is a pretty basic windfall story, so the proper advice would be to probably just stick it in index funds, take what i make, and run with it. What makes my situation different is that three years ago, I had an opportunity to invest in a super-duper small (<$1M revenue) cpg company that I thought had a ton of potential. Essentially, as I had hoped, the company has really blown up over the last three years. Their e-commerce growth is off the charts, they're landing major retailers left and right, and making major inroads in a massive market. I currently own 9.47% of all outstanding shares of a company that was most recently valued at $25m (four months ago for a small cash raise) and is now probably closer to $30m because sales have been stronger than expected. They're going to net around $2M this year, but they're not going to pay dividends because we all think it's best if it's reinvested. But they're a bit older than me and anxious to make some money, so next year at the latest I'll start receiving dividend checks at an incredible 75/25 ratio. According to projections, I'll receive around $350k next year, and I'm hoping that number will continue to rise in the years to come - and of course I have good reason to believe it will, though I don't take anything for granted. 

This investment has been a total secret. Only my girlfriend knows about it, besides the people (two of my friends) that are directly involved, but they're keeping it under wraps as well. 

Sorry for the long backstory, but I wanted to provide as much information as I possibly could to give context. 

I have no idea what to do now. Half of me wants to quit my job, but I know I shouldn't. I'm fortunate to not have to be on call during business hours, so I could theoretically work when the market is closed and focus solely on trading when it's open. I'm in a position of unique leverage and I want to maximize it, which is why I'm coming to you guys. I'm not asking for any specific stock advice, of course, but more for a discussion about what others would do if they found themselves in my situation. If you could take two minutes to think about how I should optimize my time, books I should read, software I should learn, anything at all, it would be GREATLY appreciated. As I said in the title, I'm not willing to mess this up. Thank you for reading, and thanks in advance for any responses. 

TL;DR: 26 y/o, making 80k/yr t stable job, had 180k in liquid assets. Received 5-year 500k interest-free loan from family member, also have roughly $3 million worth of equity invested in a profitable business that will start paying large dividends in 2017. What would you do in my situation to leverage your position?

2016-05-23 12:27:13,Holy Crap...I'm beating the Market! (Over 4 years),"The other day posted a question: [Where to find a Free Portfolio tracker that does Time Weighted Returns?](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4kins2/free_online_portfolio_tracker_that_does_time/)

And /u/woahhohh gave me a headsup to [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/)'s portfolio tracker. You'll have to make a free account (worth it). Check to see if they're compatible with your brokerage (mine wasnt). But I have all my transactions in Excel, so it didnt take me too long to copy and paste them over. 

When I was done, I was shocked to learn something...Im actually beating the market. Since inception (summer 2012) my Time Weighted Return has been 16.73% vs the SP500TR's 14.58%. 

One caveat though, is TWR assumes reinvested dividends. I dont actually do that, although I do invest a little each week. 

The reason Im so surprised is my largest position (>40%) is AAPL and my cost basis is like $112. Yea I know. That's on top of another huge position of mine in AAPL that lost big --I sold just before its rebound in 2013ish.

Another thing, is Id be a lot better off I had never sold a single share. For one, I had a GOOGL cost basis in the mid $600's presplit. (That's low $300's post-split for the layperson.) I had WFC shares in the low 30's. MCD's shares in the mid 80's. And of course all those hundreds of AAPL shares at about $78 on a split adjusted basis. 

So in other words, I am not a prolific man. But it is gratifying to know, that every stock I've bought...with the except of UNP...has turned into a huge winner. Even if I later sold them prematurely. 

So that tells me to be more confident in the stocks I own. 

And just so no one accuses me of cherry picking, here's my entire portfolio:

Ticker and Cost Basis

GOOGL (closed)

AAPL 112

BRK.B high 130's

DIS low 60's

MCD (closed)

UNP (closed)

WFC high 40's

Now the real issue, is that I'm doing this instead of taking that CFA lvl 1 Mock and heading to the gym.

Edit: Not sure where all the negativity is coming from, except for ya know, this being the internet and all. My post isnt cock-waggling. I was pleasantly surprised to actually be **up** on the market after years of thinking I was losing to it. I'm not opening up a hedge fund with this track record, jesus guys. Lighten up.

2016-07-01 13:52:35,My Chart of the S&P500 and where I think we're going,"http://imgur.com/cIcJAwr

The Brexit drop has now given us a lower high and lower low. Traditionally that is what we call a ""Down trend"" 

Also note the sloping trendline today which we've rejected. As price goes lower from today's high if you were to look at a daily chart you'd see a pattern called a ""shooting star"" where price reached an intraday high but sellers forced the price substantially lower. This is also generally a bearish sign.

The Brexit drop was from about 2113-1991 = 122 basis points. If am right about the wave count the next wave down has a first price target of around 1900-1910 where the next wave will be 197 points down. (122 x the fibonacci 1.618) if not then the lower target would be around 1782 where abouts 122 x 2.618 would be the number of basis points we drop.

Couple that the the fact that Utilities, Gold and treasuries have been leading. This is not typically normal bull market behaviour to see the safe haven trades leading. 

Bond Yields continue to drop world-wide.

2016-08-16 12:10:03,Extinction Level Risk - Investor Complacency,"The sanguinity of investors on here really piss me off. There is some naive view that everything will just work out. But we are looking at a world of full of major dislocations that we know of which would make 2008 seem like a joke. 

Europe: Between ultra nationalist rising, borders being thrown up, people forget Western Europe is a bigger economy than the U.S. All without deposit insurance, a centralized fiscal authority and a banking system that is levered to the hilt at around 20-30x (the worst the US got to was 22 during the GFC and it is now at 11-13x). This has been a slow moving crisis for 2-3 years. The end game will still have to be massive recapitalization of the banking system or allow a chain reaction banking system collapse. Brexit was just the start, Frexit is next, Italyexit is coming. Interbank systems locking up is only a matter of time.

China: Largest build up of debt in the world. Ghost buildings and misallocation of capital. China's banking system grew from 3 trillion to 34 trillion from 2006 to 2016. To compare, the US' banking system is 15 trillion, with an economy 1.5x as large. There will have to be massive banking recapitalization as a result. Just how low will the RMB go when they need to cover 2-3 trillion of losses in the banking system or allow widespread defaults to happen? There goes the 3 trillion fx reserves. What happens to other EM? Welcome to Asian Financial Crisis 2.0.

Japan: Demographic time bomb. Insolvent government being propped up by printing money to buy JGBs. negative yield, banks that are going bust because of negative yields. Age 65 over increasing from 35% to 45% over the next 10 years. These old people are drawing down their savings, there is no buyer of assets or new depositors in the system anymore. The whole thing is a house of cards, which could explode any second either with a hyperinflationary collapse or a deflationary collapse cause by a banking system collapse. You are one supply shock in oil away from Zimbabwe in Japan, when monetization will have to meet with convexity. 

There is a massive level of structural issues around the world, none of which is being fixed, and the can is just being kicked down the road. The US is looking better than the rest, but we are talking about extinction level risk for the largest (EU), 3rd largest (China and 4th largest (japan) economy simultaneously.

2016-09-08 02:21:07,eSports Investing: Is it a good idea?,"For those of you who do not know what exactly eSports is, it is a form of competition that is facilitated by electronic systems, particularly video games.

What is most impressive about investment opportunities is that eSports are still in their infancy. While already boasting fan numbers in the hundred millions, eSports viewership is expected and projected to continue to grow, reaching nearly 150 million viewers before the end of the decade. While major companies like Coke, Nissan, and Red Bull have already joined as sponsors, the possibilities for investments are endless. In addition, Amazon purchased Twitch, an online community for gamers. The number of fans, the number of opportunities, and the number of gamers seem to be ever-growing.

The biggest concern for investors is profit. eSports gaining fans is a good sign, but perhaps more so are the players’ earnings. In ESPN’s report, the winner of the DOTA2 Champions won $5 million in 2014. The only champions earning more were from the Super Bowl, who are players already on million dollar salaries, and the World Series of Poker. In addition, of the top eight sport championship earners, four of them were from eSports.

If nothing else, eSports provide an enormously public platform. Because games are easily viewable online, the numbers grow much faster than other sports. In addition, one article from CNBC pointed out that the only thing eSports needs to do to grow is continue to play new games. While professional sports leagues institute rule changes or bring up new expansion teams to make the game seem newer, eSports simply need to play released games from an already profitable industry. The article also pointed out that the Internet has brought together an industry of gamers, who have been connected since gaming became a trend. Imagine the possibilities for people who live their whole lives with both video games and the internet.

What’s perhaps the best thing about eSports is that it truly requires a skillset. While people may find themselves beating their friends at video games, when one looks at the eSports world they can see how talented each professional gamer is. If nothing else, eSports is certainly an entertaining outlet for its audience.

2016-09-10 00:47:09,Going to school for free. Should I still take advantage of student loans?,"Hey guys and gals, first post here so let's get to it.


I’m young, and painfully aware that I “don’t know everything about everything, or much about anything.” I’m posting this to get feedback from older, more experienced, and smarter investors than I.



I'm wondering if it’s a good idea to take advantage of federal and private student and VA loans that are deferred until 6 - 9 months after you graduate?



I qualify for 100% of my Post 9/11 GI benefits, will be working part-time, etc, etc.



But let's say that on top of that, my freshman year I borrow roughly $50,000.00 in deferred federal student loans (current IR's are about 4.69%) with a grace period of 6 months after graduation.)



The plan is to invest this capital into various opportunities that, after much deliberation and analysis, should grow at about 9 - 12% per year.



But for the sake of the argument let's say that I play it safe and dump it all into an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index. Something like SPY.



Historically, The SPY ETF's (and S&P 500) growth rate is roughly 8 -10% per year. We're going to go conservative here and adjust that to a constant 7 – 8.5% just in case. Did I mention that the SPY ETF pays a quarterly dividend? (2.02% or $4.34/share annually) Dividends that I intend to DRIP right back into the SPY to compound this financial momentum.



(Conservative) Estimates of growth from years 1 - 4:



1st year: 50,000 x 8.5% = $54,250.00 + annual dividend payment of $986.00



2nd year: $55,286.00 x 7.6% = $59,487.00 + Dividends of $1,066.00



3rd year $60,552.00 x 8.8% = $65,880 + Dividends of $1,127.00



4th year: $67,007.00 x 7.0% = $71,697.00 + Dividends of $1,215.00



Total: $72,912.00



Repayment option A: Upon graduation I would sell my position and repay the loan before the interest rates or payments were activated. Netting me a cool $22,912.00



Repayment option B: Make monthly payments on the loan with my extra income to widdle it down before graduation. The logic behind this is getting and investing 50k NOW and then paying it off vs. saving and investing 50k over 4 or 5 years. I'm thinking about the Time Value of Money here.



This growth is ONLY from the $50,000.00 loan and does not include my existing position in the SPY ETF or any other investment I am part of.



On top of this, the extra income I make from my GI bill benefits and part time work will be saved and invested (estimated around +$2,500.00/month x 8 school months = $10,000.00 per year) into stocks, options, and other securities that I deem beneficial to my portfolio.



What do you think? What have I not accounted for? What obvious financial truth have I ignored or missed or am simply not aware of? Please leave your feedback below with valid points as to why it’s a good or bad idea as well as other suggestions to wisely invest during my early twenties (Please don’t say TSP. That’s taken care of.) Any and all advice is much appreciated!",3,15

Without derailing too much, if you google ""More proof Jesus existed than Julius Caesar"", you'll find a good 3 million hits, yet it is just readily accepted by some churchgoers. I feel that the circular logic around here seems to stem largely out of this fear of missing out


1. '*Past performance is not indicative of future results*', your quintessential RDS, yet it seems to get read like; ""if nobody can predict the future, then anyone who tries is an idiot who will lose all their money', I mean, how do you suppose professionals evaluate companies without historical financial data?


2. '[Over the past 20 years, only 25% of actively managed funds beat the index](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-and-passive-aggressive-investing-heard-on-the-street-1428075416)', and most managed funds don't beat the index every year, so anyone who takes on any above average systematic risk is an idiot and will lose all their money


3. '*Time in the market beats timing the market*', what does that *even mean*? Does that mean you don't reduce your exposure to risky assets like tech or financial stocks before the Brexit referendum, or any other macro/event risks like PMI, FOMC announcements/decisions? Because ou hold the entire index now you're now **fully diversified**, and anyone who isn't is on their way to financial ruin


4. '[Active fund managers are so stupid even monkeys could beat them](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/monkeys-are-better-stock-pickers-than-fund-managers-experiment-2013-4)'. Does it make the headlines when monkeys fail to beat the benchmark? That and if you read the fineprint the benchmark is stacked in favour of the monkeys, not to mention market-cap portfolios being archaic (Guess what the VTI is)


It seems to me that a majority of the people here don't even understand compound returns; let alone things that are only a tiny bit more complicated like beta slippage. and if your first thought to that is ""No, Einstein told me compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world"" then you're precisely the person I'm referring to, you start getting [threads like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/5alwc2/is_it_even_worth_it_to_put_your_money_in_anything/), when you have this amount of misinformation, you start getting people asking questions like ""why don't every investor ever always passive index the US S&P 500""?

2016-11-07 12:23:35,common mainstream misconceptions about equity market and economy correlations,"Income inequality is good, not bad: Income inequality means less people are competing with existing incumbent businesses, allowing incumbents to continue monopolizing their industry. As income inequality grows, equity markets grow and continue booming, not bust.

Less people starting businesses is a bad thing: You hear this from people like Mark Cuban and a lot of analyst on CNBC or other financial news outlets. (Don't listen to them, they are for entertainment only). But the truth is less entrepreneurs equates to less competition to incumbents, allowing the incumbents to further establish themselves. If a business does pose a threat, that business is either bought or killed. The days where a company go from Facebook with a $1B valuation to a $350B valuation are over. 
Don't believe me? Look at the market cap of ALL companies STARTED post 2000, combine them, and it's less than the market cap of Facebook.

The gig economy is amazing for corporate america, not bad: Don't need to pay health insurance, or retirement? Can make employees dispensable? Great. Don't be foolish, people don't grow up aspiring to be Uber drivers, it's just drivel you hear in the media. People do freelance type work because they have to. In other words, they can't start their own self-sustaining, independent businesses and they can't find employment, so they enter servitude-work.

Overall, as long as people are poor enough to spend all or most their money (this is a thing, the poorer people are the more money as a % of their wealth they spend, as desperation and negative long-term outlook sets in. Good example is lottery tickets, an act of desperation) but rich enough to not want to riot and cause unrest, the stock market will continue to rise. Keep people on thing s like food stamps to keep them full for example, otherwise unrest sets in.

And this is the direction the world, not the country per se is headed in. What to make of all this? There will be an unprecedented bull market for as long as income inequality and lack of business start-ups continue. With millennials being the LEAST entrepreneurial generation in american history (lots of amazing reads on this, just look it up, huge decline in business startups in the recent 18-35 yr old generation compared to previous generations) corporatism will keep growing stronger and will be more embedded. 

So next time you retweet a Bernie Sanders tweet about income inequality, just remember there's incentive to further income inequality, not stop it. ",0,15

2017-03-07 20:02:42,Day trading failure.,Hello guys. Just need some advice on my situation. I'm a student who is also working full time and began trading my savings in the market a year ago. My account was 22k which was my life savings . I'm 25. I had s relatively risky appetite and would take positions 50-100% my account size and had days where I lost 1000 and days where I made that amount and more. I usually traded leveraged etfs.Looking at my account a year later I realized I'm a failure . Account went from 22k to 16k. It hurts because for me 6k is quite a bit being a relatively broke student and that being my life savings. I've decided with working and going to school trading is not for me and I will move on from it for now to focus and completing my degree as I spent so much time in the past year with this . I'm almost as disappointed in how if effected my grades as well. Anyways just having trouble with all the things I could have done with 6k. I'm a pretty frugal guy and enjoy saving and not buying too much things so just wasting that hurts but also want to see if I'm overreacting . Any thoughts? Thanks,1,32

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for short bursts of activity on Twitter, oftentimes answering fans and reporters questions on the social media platform.

On Friday, as Musk was on a flight to Cape Canaveral—presumably to attend to business related to SpaceX, the aerospace company he also runs—the billionaire entrepreneur shared a number of new details about the Model 3, a video, and even the solar roof tiles Tesla plans to sell.

Here’s what we learned:

First the basics, Musk wanted to clarify that Model 3 is not simply a next version of a Tesla.

He later got more specific about the Model 3 in response to several questions from the above tweet.

- It will have Autopilot capabilities, which has been shared before.
- It will still be awesome. When asked Musk’s reply was “definitely.”
- Musk then added the Model 3 will be like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. “Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot,” he tweeted.
- It should be able to fit a large cooler in the trunk of the Model 3 (a response a concern about trunk space in sedans).
- It won’t contain any significantly new technology that has yet to be introduced to the S or X. Musk says there’s lots of new tech in the design and production process, but nothing “majorly new that a consumer would notice.”
- The shorter wheelbase of the Model 3 only allows for a 75 kilowatt-hour battery pack in Model 3. But, that doesn’t mean it won’t have a greater range than the Chevy Bolt EV, which can travel 238 miles on a single charge.

2017-04-04 13:37:49,Why I'm so incredibly bullish about Tesla,"I ended up making this long post below as a comment in one of the recent Tesla threads, but I figured it was deserving of its own post. Here's a summary of the reasons I'm super bullish on Tesla.

&nbsp;

**Betting on Elon Musk**

Betting on someone like Elon Musk is potentially incredibly profitable. To build a company that will succeed as I believe Tesla will, you need the boldest, most visionary, brilliant leader you can find, and no one compares to Elon Musk. I loved Steve Jobs, but I think Musk has a huge edge on even him. Literally every company he's run has destroyed its market. It's his track record of being able to foresee the future and build companies around dominating a future market, rather than the current market. Take his first venture Zip2 for example, that market didn't even exist at the time, and he built it from scratch. Then X.com, which later became paypal. Again, he built a company in a market that barely existed, he created the market, and paypal is enormous now.


Again, with SpaceX, people laughed at him thinking he was doing the impossible, but look at what they're doing now. And for Tesla to come as far as it has in this amount of time, and for their cars to have gotten such high praise, it's just mind boggling. Elon Musk is the real deal, the kind of visionary with a coupled insane work ethic and ability to deliver on outlandish promises. If there's anyone to bet on, it's him.


Because of Musk's cult like following, they can hire the brightest engineers, and work them exceptionally hard. Not too different from Apple here. People literally want to go work their asses off for this guy so they can build the future. I'm a software engineer, and I HATE working hard, but I tried very hard (and failed) to get a job at SpaceX, because I wanted to work my ass off and change the world.

&nbsp;

**The SpaceX synergy**

I think many investors overlook the SpaceX synergy with Tesla. Sure, they're building wildly different products, but they're still both manufacturing cutting edge technological machines. Lessons learned from either company can be transferred between the two. Also brilliant engineers can go between the two companies. This creates a serious multiplying force for both companies.

&nbsp;

**Company Culture**

Tesla's company culture is built from the ground up to be highly innovative, fast moving, and completely dominate the future market. Sure, GM, Ford, etc. can and will start making more EVs, but their companies are not built for the future. They're built for the past, and the old ways of doing things are quickly going to become a liability. Tesla is a manufacturing company, but they have learned a lot of lessons from Silicon Valley tech companies and employ similar strategies of flatter hierarchy, which boosts ground up innovation, and quick iterative engineering practices.

&nbsp;

**Product Quality**

It doesn't matter right now. They're reliable enough for early adopters, and early adopters don't care that much about reliability. This is evidenced in polls about owner satisfaction which rank very high. Building a car company from scratch, it takes many years to work out all the issues, and I have no doubt quality will be greatly improved on with the model 3 as production is greatly scaled up and they apply changes to manufacturing from lessons learned.

&nbsp;

**But, but, but profits...**

Telsa would have to be stupid to take profits now, or for that matter anytime in the next 10 years! They are not building a company for the current market, they are building a company for the future market, and that requires reinvesting 100% into growth and R&D. This is why the other auto makers will not be able to keep up. Sure, they'll be making EVs, but they simply cannot commit even a fraction of the capital into growing into the future. Whereas this is Tesla's entire purpose.

&nbsp;

**The iPhone moment**

I, and many others, think Tesla is going to have an iPhone like moment, and potentially with the model 3. Where they release a car that is so compelling there would be no reason to buy another car in the same price range. This will spur huge interest into EVs from the general public, and Tesla will be poised to grow into that market, as they've been anticipating. Whereas other car makers will be left scrambling as they are barely making any EVs and will not be able to ramp production to meet demand.

&nbsp;

**Optimizing Manufactoring**

Did you watch the talk Elon Musk and JB Straubel gave at the gigafactory opening? It literally gave me chills. Musk was talking about how they designed the factory, how it's like a multilayer CPU, and all this stuff about how they're basically reinventing automated manufacturing. They are not beholden to doing things the way they have always been done, they are dropping all that technological debt and building things from the ground up to be as efficient and automated as possible.

&nbsp;

**First principles thinking**

Musk loves what he calls first principles thinking, where he breaks something down into the most basic physical properties, and tries to figure out what the floor of cost is for a product. SpaceX and Tesla are built around this way of thinking, and because of this, they can literally do the impossible. Musk thinks from the ground up. Rather than just making a slight improvement to something, he wants to figure out what are the limits of physics on producing a good. So if you're making a battery, you need X materials at Y mining cost, so the minimum cost is the raw materials, so how do you create a finished product for as close to this minimum as possible? It's literally striving for the impossible, but in this striving they are able to cut the price by a ridiculous margin. This is a big part of the SpaceX, Tesla secret sauce. Other manufactures might look at a product and say, well X company makes it for this price, lets produce it for 10% less and dominate the market. But Musk is literally going from the ground up, thinking if this was 100% optimized from mineral extraction to final sale, what would it cost, now lets work our asses off to get as close to that number as possible.

&nbsp;

**Amazon was not just a book seller, Tesla is not just a car maker**

Many ""smart"" investors missed the boat on making huge returns on amazon, because they labeled them a book seller, and tried to traditionally value the company as such. If you had paid attention to what Bezos was saying back then and the course he was plotting, it would have been clear that he was building a company to dominate the then emerging online marketplace. If you believed at the time those markets would be huge, it would have been a very smart investment. I think you can see the parallel with Tesla, they are not just another car company. They are building a company to dominate the emerging EV, solar, and electricity storage markets. If you think those markets will be huge, and think Tesla has a good chance to take a big chunk of the market, then it's a very wise investment.

&nbsp;

**The future will be electric**

In my mind, this is a done deal. You can look at the trends, solar prices have been plummeting for years, batteries are getting cheaper and better, etc. We are quickly nearing a tipping point. Sure, there are dinosaurs like Trump that want to bring back coal, but the market has spoken already and renewables are going to become so cost effective that agenda won't matter. So, if the future is destined to be electric, what is the valuation of a company that has vertical integration of the key products of this future, solar panels, batteries, and EVs?

&nbsp;

**The future will be automated**

Tesla has been criticized for putting out ""beta"" software for self driving, but this is a strategic part of their plan. The current trend in AI, and what's working very well in many disciplines (ie: deepmind) is getting massive datasets to train multi layer machine learning algorithms. This is Tesla's plan. They are getting immense amounts of data currently, while the other players sit on their hands and try to design the ultimate self driving car before releasing it. It's not possible, you need the millions of miles of training data, and Tesla alone will have this. This is why they are not using LIDAR, because they understand the training dataset is the real asset, and they can acquire that data much more quickly by getting as many cars on the road with cameras as quickly as possible. I expect the quality of the self driving AI will begin getting better at an exponential rate in the next year or two, and those other auto makers that are building AI behind closed doors will be left in the dust, maybe even wanting to license the tech from Tesla.

&nbsp;

**TLDR**

Yeah, I have a huge hard on for Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX, but it's justified because he's proven time and time again that he's capable of achieving the impossible. Tesla is designed to completely dominate the future car and energy markets, and the existing companies simply won't be able to keep pace because they were designed to dominate a market that will be antiquated within 10 years. The future will be electric, and Tesla is poised to take a large chunk of an immense industry, so future 1 trillion valuations are not outlandish. For all I know the stock price is overvalued right now and may drop a good deal, but I'm investing in the long term vision and would rather not take a chance on missing a dip that may never happen.",0,58

2017-05-11 07:19:42,Snap is an awesome prospect with an inflated price,"I shorted Snap from 23.02 a couple of days ago, but I'm just waiting for a good entry point to go long. I'm seeing a lot of nonsense flying around about Snap now, and I wanted to put in my two cents.

First let me clarify a few things. The 'we may never achieve profitability' quote from their S-1 that people keep using as some warning of Snap's weakness is just a typical legal disclaimer found in all S-1. I don't know why people keep quoting it as if it's some unique insight.

Secondly, Snap's first earnings tanked - as did Facebook's, as did Twitter's, as did Tesla's, as do a lot of tech-oriented IPO's. It means virtually nothing long term. The point of an IPO is to raise cash, and a lot of companies go public with inflated prices to raise that cash, then take the hit for a few quarter's earnings.

The reason I'm investing in Snap myself (when they're at a fair price) is that they have THE best augmented reality software around. Hands down. For all that Facebook can copy stories, their filters are just stickers placed over the live camera view. Snap filters are applied to a 3d object (your head, usually) in 3d space. 

Their facial recognition is also precise and refined enough to alter features of your expression - in real time - and still look realistic. Even the most basic filters on the app widen the eyes a little, apply paling and contouring to the right spots, recognises open mouths and raised eyebrows. This is literally like live photoshopping a picture to make you attractive. If you want to know why girls in particular love this app, then this is it. 

Far bigger companies are still struggling to get instant iris recognition and facial focus right. The closest competitor to this is Microsoft's Hololens, a $1000+ product, and some inferior Chinese-market apps. While Facebook (who people keep saying are going to destroy snap) have settled on stickers.

Their augmented reality is now at a level where they can not only alter complex objects in real space, but they can even remove objects from 3d space. Here is a video of the company which Snap acquired early on, which shows how powerful a lot of this is.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjrLjS5kQ2k&t=2s

I know the fact they're using this incredible technology for doggy filters and beautifying teenage girls makes it easy to dismiss them, but the tech alone makes them valuable. They're ahead of almost everyone in this regard, and if you can't see that AR is the next massive growth market then you may as well just invest in Facebook and treat it like a pension fund. The fact Zuckerberg is desperately altering the fundamental attractions of everything he owns because he's so afraid of Snap should be a warning to those skeptical of it, not those optimistic about it.

People are obsessing about the ad revenue, but I think Snap are still figuring out the best way to capitalise on their own innovations. It may not even be ads, it might be turning it into a service, or selling an actual product. I think this is smart. Google and Facebook have monopolised the ad market. It's not even worth competing.

Considering this is a company which brought a successful hardware product to market, it's not hard to imagine a future where Snap combine spectacles and their AR technology. Sure, they might use this powerful tech to do something silly, like create glasses which turn everyone you see into anime rabbit-girls in real-time, or make downtown Detroit look like the mushroom kingdom, but would you bet against those things selling like hotcakes? I'm not saying they will do that, just that the possibilities are kinda wild if you actually think about them.

Lastly, I just want to say I think a lot of people are overlooking Snap because it's a fashion brand, one that appeals to trendy teenage girls, and so must be trashy. Whereas AMD, a company which makes inferior chips to Intel and Nvidia, has a crap track record, a history of issues, crap technicals, ok-ish fundamentals, and minute market share, is somehow a great and promising investment (I love AMD, but I'm making a point). I see so many of the best stocks on the market go unnoticed simply because they involve fashion, or make-up, while stuff like graphics chips and gopros gather these absurd cult followings.

When it comes to the next great tech breakthroughs, Steve Wozniak isn't betting on the company he founded.

Instead, he believes Tesla is at the forefront of anticipating the world to come.


In an interview with Bloomberg Canada, Woz explained that he believes Elon Musk will be behind the things no one has really thought of.

""I think Tesla is on the best direction right now,"" he said. ""They've put an awful lot of effort into very risky things.""

Woz said Musk anticipated things like electric cars, self-driving cars and the need for efficient transportation systems. He expressed admiration for Musk's Boring Company, which believes that digging holes beneath the surface will obviate traffic.


""I'm going to bet on Tesla,"" he said.

Why, though, is Tesla different? ""They started with a car -- the Tesla Model S -- that made little sense in engineering terms in how much you have to build for what price and what the market will be,"" he said

Why, then, did the Model S succeed? ""It fit one person's ideal of this will be the most beautiful, you know, a very beautiful, elegant and simple device to use,"" said Woz.

Some might imagine that Woz had Steve Jobs' -- and his own -- attitude in mind when he chose Musk as the next standard-bearer. After all, Apple created the sorts of computers that no one thought even looked like computers. (Which was, of course, why real human beings gravitated toward them.)

Now, however, Woz didn't mention Apple as being in the vanguard of the next big thing. A clue to why emerged from his subsequent words.


""Look at the companies like Google and Facebook and Apple and Microsoft that changed the world -- and Tesla included. They usually came from young people. They didn't spring out of big businesses,"" he said.

Apple is now a very big business. Might Woz be slyly suggesting that Cupertino can't quite match the more cavalier creative nature of Musk? I think he just might.

Short interest liability on TSLA at $10.6 Billion and counting.,"As Tesla reaches new ATH's today all significant short positions are underwater and the liability is growing. Tesla being the most shorted stock on the Nasdaq - the amazing thing about Tesla's run this year is that essentially none of it so far has been caused by net short covering. Which is why i always laugh to myself when people repeat the common mantra that it is overvalued at current levels. Once the short interest unwinds to more normal levels, then we can talk overvalued.

I can see that the crypto market is booming, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.

From my research Bitcoin has grown and with the new all time high it hit, I don't think anyone has lost money by investing, assuming their coins just sat there.

I also see NEO was trading at ~$2 in early June, and it peaked at $40 dollars, a 20x return! 

It seems this market is fueled by nothing but speculation, but that doesn't seem to be a problem. 

From my research, it seems stupid not to take advantage of this exploding market, even though there are some unknowns involved. I would only put spare change in, so I'm not worried about losing it.

Wouldn't this be a better investment as opposed to traditional stocks?

2017-10-15 05:09:36,"Why 401k's are a scam (abandon all hope, ye who enter)","I had an...interesting discussion with a close friend.

He works a ~$25 per hour blue collar factory job, and absolutely refuses to invest a dime into retirement.

Warning: there is some really stupid shit coming up. I can't make sense of it, and you probably won't be able to, either. I'm just looking for a way to navigate it, explain it, and help him onto the ""right path"" because he's a friend. I'm trying to be optimistic.

My friend is insistent that 401(k)s are a scam. He believes that pensions were great because they were 100% guaranteed to pay out to employees. Yes, I know that they aren't, but I couldn't convince him otherwise.

Despite my best efforts at explaining the basics, he is insistent that 401(k) programs are awful because the company you work for can impose ""all sorts of"" fees and taxes whenever you withdraw money from the account. He insists that they will charge you when you add money, and they will charge you when take money out. They will keep charging you while you invest, and you'll end up with nothing. He believes that the person ""managing your 401(k)"" will take all of your money. Perhaps, the company you work for will take all of the money from your 401(k) if they choose to. Maybe the company you work for will file bankruptcy and take everyone's 401(k) with it. They can do that because they ultimately own all the money that you put into your 401(k).

He says that you can invest into a 401(k) for years and years, and then your account will be less than half of what you put into it. In his mind, the market can go up, and it can go down. When he retires, the market will be down, and he will have nothing.

He knows a guy that went to take money from his 401(k) when he retired, but there was nothing there because investing is like a casino; you might win or lose, but you'll lose. It's better to save cash.

I tried to explain rebalancing, but it wasn't effective. In his eyes, there is no reason to contribute to a 401(k); you're better off just saving cash and not spending money. That's the only way to a happy retirement in his eyes. Like you, I also have no idea what that means.

He is 100% adamant that if you die while you invest in a 401(k), the money is lost. I asked where he thinks it ""goes"", but he wasn't sure. ""Wall street"", ""fund managers"", ""the company I work for""...one of those. I tried to explain the concept of beneficiaries to no avail. He insists that it gets taken by someone.

Additionally, it's stupid to invest in a 401(k) because he knows a guy that invested all his life and then was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. The guy has to pay $5,000 every month for his medication, so it was pointless for him to save for his retirement because this guy he knows had to spend all his money on his medicine.

I could go on, but you get the point. I suspect that he obtains his information from rambling fringe Youtube videos such as this one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxHF8l1xPC0

If you've made it this far...I applaud your constitution. I have a simple question. Is he a lost cause? How can I explain investing for retirement in the simplest, and I mean SIMPLEST possible terms? Does anyone know of some EXTREMELY basic Youtube videos that I can point him to in order to get these goofy ideas out of his thought processes?",0,14

2017-10-30 10:47:06,"First year of investing wasn't good, but the past year has been","I had never had any financial background before, except for a mandatory personal finance class in high school that I regrettably didn't take much from. Fast forward a year, and I decided to download the new Robinhood app that came out. I was 18 at the time and was always trying get rich quick schemes, so I threw $10 into the app and gambled away. Gambling is definitely the word, because I didn't do any DD at all and just bought volatile penny stocks at market price and immediately set a limit order for 1% above what I bought at. Pretty shitty strategy, but not bad for my first one.  
  
I don't think I ever had any good gains from that strategy. At this time I was slowly adding a little bit of money into Robinhood from my paycheck every 2 weeks, because compound interest calculator got me dreaming bout the possibilities. I was always fond of probability and statistics and for the next year and a half, I worked my ass off trying to create formulas that worked more than 50% of the time. I would use historical data to backtest the formulas and would put to use formulas/methods I thought would work. After that first year and a half, I think was down about 30% at my worst, with $2000 in RH. It was around this time that I said fuck it and starting bagholding stocks.  
  
Around August of last year, I threw all my money into SPXL, TECL, and various tech stock. I'd always done technical trading up until this point, but decided to through my all into the technology sector, with SPXL being my insurance. I held those positions for about 6 months and I had great results! About 20-25% gains if I remember. So I decided to do something I said I would never do, and enrolled in RH's Gold program and trade on margin.  
  
Everything my dad had my gut had told about debt told me it was a bad idea to trade money that isn't mine, but the last 6 months of gains had me so confident since the graph line was so stable for that time period.  
  
Fast forward to today and my current % gain for the past year is 48%. That % would be higher, but it is diluted because of constant deposits into RH if that makes sense. I am 21 now, make $13.50/hour, but have managed to live very very frugal so I can deposit half of my untaxed paycheck into RH. Thanks to thank, my RH account value is now $22,500.  
  
I just wanted to let people now that it can be done. You can read about Investing, but give it a try yourself. You can play around with just $10 at the start like I did with RobinHood since they don't have transaction fees. I'm not claiming to be an expert, but if my experience can help someone, then it is worth it. I can try to answer any questions as well.

Yes, I know JC Penny, has been in decline for awhile and have massive debt; however, I doubt they will file bankruptcy. I see them doing a total restructure that will differentiate themselves from others, which will result in huge growth.

2017-11-15 18:10:36,Market Outlook Going into 2018? Will the Market Crash?,"The Housing Market Crash from 2007-2008 forever scarred both the domestic and international markets in one of the greatest failures both attributable to the financial institutions that provided the means for the crisis and the public who fueled the madness. 

Currently, we are enjoying one of the greatest bull runs of our lifetimes and both strong consumer spending and credit bolstered by strong company fundamentals are continuing to drive the markets to consistent all-time highs. So bullish is this market that countless shorts are getting eviscerated in this massive run as the rest of the global economy continues to rise as well. Even Japan, who had suffered decades of stagnant economic growth, is now beginning to gain back some of its strength back through strong economic strides. 

As Fed Chair Janet Yellen steps down, fellow board member Jerome Powell will be taking her place which is good for the markets as both share similar views. This continuation in the markets is a mark of consistency that will continue Yellen's work in the past which has helped the markets to recover. With all these factors in place, there is strong evidence to suggest that there is still yet more room for the markets to grow even at these all-time high levels. 

Bitcoin is emerging as the top contender for the next bubble and is represented as a significant risk to the markets. Although the valuation of Bitcoin is a little absurd, the cryptocurrency alongside others are not integrated enough with both society and the economy due to the lack of practical use for Bitcoin at this point in time. Considering that many still do not use payments (or even know what it is) in addition to the fact that most businesses do not accept Bitcoin payment, even if Bitcoin were to collapse, the current situation hints that Bitcoin will not be the bubble, at least not now.

Overall, the markets are enjoying a time of great prosperity and a renewed revival of the investment community. Although there are many caution signs to be aware of, being out of the markets completely is not the right option either.

2017-12-19 08:53:40,"Why would anyone prefer growth over dividend when considering an etf, it makes no sense to me. More info in the text.","Firstly I'm an idiot that has never invested yet. So I'm most probably wrong and hope that I am, here's my reasoning why growth does not make sense. Please don't downvote cause I'm probably going to say something dumb but I'm sure a lot of other beginners might be facing this problem and could benefits from the more experienced investors that are about to destroy my argument. Well here's why I think growth makes no sense.

let's take the S&P 500 etf for example. Lets Assume that it always has an 8% growth and a 2% dividend to make things simple. If I understood how dividend works it's basically I get 2 dollars for every 100 dollars I invested through the year. Than That's taxed and I see more money in my brokers account that I can invest correct?

Now if I'm understanding growth correctly which I most probably am not is that the company (lets assume the S&P 500 is one company) has increased by 8% in value but that would not represent an increase in the etf share value right? 

What I mean by this is Let's assume that 1 etf share of the S&P 500 value costs 100 dollars. If for the whole year no one bought or sold a single share of the S&P 500. It would remain costing 100 dollars and not 108 dollars right? because the etf price is simply determined by if people bought more (increasing the price of the etf) or sold more (reduced the price of the etf) or is it?

This simply does not make sense to me I mean let's take apple for example. Let's say they are killing it and making a shit ton of profit this year but for some reason A guy that has 70% of there shares decides to sell all of his shares resulting in the shares losing price  even thought apple has had there best year my share price would crash resulting in a decrease of my portfolio even though in reality apple as a company is doing greater than any other year right?

This can also happen the other way round where a company is doing shit but due to maybe previous success people are buying there shares increasing there price even though in reality they didn't do shit this year. Resulting in an increase in my portfolio even though the company did shit. 

What role does the average growth has on share price I can understand dividends, but the value of my etf share seems to just base on what other people value it and not what the actual company is doing? Are we simply glorified gamblers that hope people buy the same etf share we do?

I hope I don't come out offensive or as if I'm some kind of troll I really can't get the grasp of this. Thanks for all those that manage to beat my 'argument' that growth makes no sense.

Worth a read. I've insisted blockchain's going to change the world but..maybe not? Maybe there's not actually a use. 10 years is an eternity in terms of tech development. 

>The original intended use of the blockchain was to power currencies like bitcoin — a way to store and exchange value much like any other currency. Visa and MasterCard were dinosaurs, everyone proclaimed, because there was now a costless, instant way to exchange value without the middleman taking a cut. A revolution in banking was just the start… governments, unable to issue currency by fiat anymore, would take a back seat as individual citizens transacted freely outside any national system.

>The killer feature: knowing you can get your money back
It didn’t take long for that dream to fall apart. For one thing, there’s already a costless, instant way to exchange value without a middleman: cash.

>...

>Plus, it’s not actually that good a payment system — Visa can handle sixty thousand transactions per second, while Bitcoin historically taps out at seven. There are technical modifications going on to improve Bitcoin’s efficiency, but as a starting point, you have something that’s about 0.01% as good at clearing transactions. (And, worth noting, for those seven transactions a second Bitcoin is already estimated to use 35 times as much energy as Visa. If you brought Bitcoin’s transaction volume up to Visa’s it would be using as much electricity as the rest of the world put together.)

>...

>In terms of interbank payments, many people mention Ripple as a promising way to transfer money between banks. Over the last 30 days it processed two billion dollars (as of this writing) worth of interbank and interpersonal transactions — about 40 seconds’ worth of volume on the SWIFT interbank network — after three years of being available to banks to trade 90% of the world’s high-volume currencies.

2017-12-27 00:55:24,"Can we either stop saying ""time in market beats market timing"" or provide support indicating that the notion is true?","Hopefully I'm not downvoted for disagreeing with an often-stated notion on this sub: ""time in the market beats market timing."" I know it sounds good and it may be true for the average Joe who wants to spend his free time with his family and let his investments take care of themselves. However, I don't personally believe it to be a truism for someone who is willing to put in the time to understand markets and take a more active approach in their investments. 

I decided to look for some research papers that focused on the topic to see if I could find any evidence one way or another and I found nothing to dissuade me from my beliefs, nor did I find anything to make me more confident in my beliefs. I wanted to post here and see if anyone has actually looked into this and found a paper with substance. I'm not talking about a CNBC or Bloomberg article, I'm talking peer-reviewed paper that compares a market timing strategy with a buy and hold and dollar cost average strategy. 

If you can find any papers that support one side of the argument or the other, please post them! If you find something but can't access the full paper, let me know. I have access to most papers through my school so I can try to get it for you and we can see what we discover. 

I started with a simple [Google Scholar search](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C11&as_ylo=2013&q=market+timing+performance+index&btnG=) and found these:

1. [Market Timing with Moving Averages: Anatomy
and Performance of Trading Rules](http://www.technicalanalyst.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SSRN-moving-average.pdf) - conclusion is that some commonly used technical indicators to time the market beat market timing in the long term, but were as likely to under-perform as they were to outperform in the medium term.
>We also performed the longest out-of-sample testing of a few distinct trading rules in order
to find out whether the real-life performance of market timing strategies can support the
existing myths and common beliefs about market timing. The results of this testing are as
follows. First, contrary to the common belief, our results indicated that there is no single
optimal lookback period in each trading rule. Second, we found no support for the common
belief that over-weighting the recent prices allows one to improve the performance of a market
timing rule. Our results suggested that equal weighing of price changes is the most optimal
weighting scheme to use in market timing. Third, we did find support for the claim that one
can beat the market by timing it. Yet the chances for beating the market depend on the length
of the investment horizon. Whereas over very long-term horizons the market timing strategy
is almost sure to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis, over more realistic mediumterm
horizons the market timing strategy is equally likely to outperform as to underperform.
Yet we found that the average outperformance is greater than the average underperformance.

2. [Can hedge funds time market liquidity?](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0304405X13000895/1-s2.0-S0304405X13000895-main.pdf?_tid=6435963e-eabd-11e7-a977-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1514348669_e138a669342978655f3bc43c319b9cb0) - to be honest, this one is way over my head. I tried to understand the figures but couldn't make heads or two-tailed T tests of it. I read the conclusion but since I can't understand the figures, I'd really just have to take their word for it, which is what I'm trying to get away from in this case. 

3. [Active Share and Mutual Fund Performance](https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v69.n4.7) - conclusion is that managers with a [high active share percentage](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/07/active-share.asp) *can* benefit from market timing to beat their corresponding index after fees, however closet indexers will under-perform due to fees. This conclusion needs to be read in full, but it doesn't really support timing *or* holding, and just tells us that there are other considerations to make. 
>Although the average actively managed mutual
fund has underperformed its benchmark index,
both the type and the degree of active management
matter considerably for performance. In my
study, I used Active Share and tracking error to sort
domestic all-equity mutual funds into five categories
on the basis of the type of active management
they practice. I found that the most active stock
pickers have been able to add value for their investors,
beating their benchmark indices by about
1.26% a year after all fees and expenses. Factor
bets have destroyed value after fees. Closet indexers
have essentially just matched their benchmark
index performance before fees, which has produced
consistent underperformance after fees. The
results are similar over the 2008–09 financial crisis,
and they also hold separately within large-cap and
small-cap funds.
Economically, these results mean that there
are some inefficiencies in the market that can be
exploited by active stock selection. Furthermore, I
found that active stock selection is most successful
at times of high cross-sectional dispersion in
stock returns. However, equity fund managers are
unable to add value by betting on broader factor
portfolios, indicating that they are more efficiently
priced than individual stocks.
For mutual fund investors, these findings suggest
that they need to pay attention to measures of
active management. When selecting mutual funds,
they should go with only the most active stock
pickers, or combine those funds with inexpensive
index funds; in other words, they should pick from
the two extremes of Active Share but not invest in
any funds in the middle. In contrast, high tracking
error is not desirable because funds that focus on
factor bets underperform and even concentrated
managers who combine active stock selection with
factor bets have not outperformed. Closet indexers
who stay very close to the benchmark index are a
particularly bad deal because they are almost guaranteed
to underperform after fees given the small
size of their active bets, yet they account for about
one-third of all mutual fund assets.

2018-01-01 22:01:43,Are ETFs really that awesome?,"The most common and popular investing advice I see is ""just buy an index fund."" That probably works for a lot of people who want to save for retirement and just forget about it. The whole idea of an ETF doesn't make sense to me, and is kind of boring. Here's why I think that:

If you're buying something like SPY, you're paying State Street Corp to buy a bunch of stocks of the ""strongest companies."" Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my understanding that the index automatically allocates capital to all of the s&p 500, in proportion to market caps. So theoretically, companies that are overvalued are being allocated more capital than companies that are not. 

This whole system offers an explanation to how overvalued companies can just continue to become more overvalued while I sit here in confusion. I also wonder what will happen when everyone saving for retirement in these ETFs wants out at the same time. Savers better hope the market doesn't collapse near retirement or take adequate measures to prevent significant loss. 

To me, buying an etf takes all the fun out of  investing. It's challenging scrounging data and figuring out what companies are strong and here to stay and grow. I can see the appeal of an ETF though, being risk averse or not interested in stock picking, or just not having time for that. It is not without its downsides though.

2018-02-10 06:15:38,[Tinfoil ?] Current Market Drama: Could this be results from a hack? Read before making assumptions.,"#Quick Introductory Short Story

***
 So I enjoy playing a game called *EVE Online: A Super Serious Spaceship Game*. It's cool and fun but that's neither here nor there. It does, however, have an advanced in-game economy like none other and mimics the fundamentals of supply vs. demand similar to real world markets. Much like every other video game there is botting and I wanted to use the notorious EVE market bot as an example for a precursor (*for the record botting is against the rules and will get you banned*). I have never personally used any botting software but from what I understand and observed is the bot simply updates buy and sell orders once it realizes it's been outbid or undersold, keeping a profitable spread. With that being said some people have managed to pinpoint certain assets where multiple bots are active. They then manipulated the buy and sell orders with their own just enough that it resulted in a hilarious bid war between said bots that ultimately inflated price of said asset until one shut down.

#Are Big Fund Market Algorithms Vulnerable?

***
I would normally assume that investment firms, hedgefunds, etc. all have the best security and IT money can buy but [the hacking of Equifax sorta took that hypothesis out back and shot it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-18/equifax-is-said-to-suffer-a-hack-earlier-than-the-date-disclosed). It is probably safe to assume these algorithms used for position hedging are extremely complex and secure, however, could they be influenced by external factors?

Much like the primitive EVE market bot I referenced earlier - I'm curious to how market algos would play out in a situation where they went unchecked with an active ""offensive"" market algo in play. This ""offensive"" market algo would be designed to throttle prices upward by influencing our market's algo tools into a bid war... in layman's terms. I understand the complexity and would prefer to not spend hours rabbling on how they work. One could hypothesize this would not be incredibly hard a task (*for a group with relevant skills*) if information was collected on said algos inner-workings... leads me to my next point.

#Cyber Warfare and Recent Hacks

***

There has been a [drove of hacking lately](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3243108/security/biggest-hacks-security-breaches-2017.html) with many U.S. entities falling victim, [even as recent as this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/russian-hackers-hunt-hi-tech-secrets-exploiting-us-weakness.html). Some of these victims are very involved with the stock market such as investment platform [Scottrade (2015)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/10/02/scottrade-broker-hacker-breach-46-million/73233356/), investment banking giant [JP Morgan Chase & Co. (2014)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/10/02/jp-morgan-security-breach/16590689/), and as previously mentioned [Equifax](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/10/02/equifax-breach-hit-2-5-million-more-americans-than-first-believed/725100001/). They mainly point towards ""*the data breaches*"" however I feel it's completely plausible malicious software could have been left behind to collect information on algorithmic tools utilized by said entities. It would also be possible for said hackers to pool small funds taken from each affected individual into a large fund. The large fund would later be used in offensive algo manipulation campaign. There has been a significant amount of news on various hackings but I feel it's probable that these stories are all smoke screens for something far more sinister.

Anyway, what I'm getting at is the hypothetical possibility market algos could fall victim to external manipulating factors that would result in hyper inflated bubbles. These massive bubbles would expand from algos running wild against one another at which point the price is propped up only by the underlying botting battle.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#Why Am I Pondering This?

***

First off I know that a large portion of trading is done by real people. With that being said we can't neglect the exponentially increasing involvement of market algo tools processing massive orders every .001 second. I mean 9:30 to 10:30 am EA is essentially an episode of robot wars every day. A constant battle back and forth of hedging .005 cent trades to direct an underlying equity down or up into it's desired PT for the day. Put and option contracts are bought and sold as powerful computers process hedging software to calculate positions that minimize exposure long term. 

I'm rambling, sorry, anyway - algo vs. algo: what made me think about this besides a game about spaceships? Look at the volume. Seriously. Look at that [explicit REE'ing Spoiler](/sp ""fucking daily volume holy dog shit something is fucked up""). The "" *Trump Bump^and^dump* "" can only explain for so much before you realize ""*wait... there is a lot more going on there...*"". What the hell happened last year? Let me illustrate what I'm talking about.

&nbsp;

**NOTE** I'm using Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform w/ additional indicators specified below:

* The chart is set to daily over 10 year period.

#I'm Tired Of Typing: My 2 Cents

***

As stated initially I am more curious about the potential than I am pointing fingers while holding the tin-foil cone firmly atop my head. The volume surge, over bought indicators, lack of correction, and exponential rise in pricing clearly indicates what could be interpreted as market algorithms battling one another. I am entertaining the idea that one or more hedge calculating tools were corrupted and/or altered to remove restrictions. This corruption or unrestricted state could thus be influenced upward outside of buy and sell order norms by offensive market algos. It's just a thought, interested in your feedback.

I've just yet to see anyone go against Schiff and directly point out flaws in his reasoning and I'm not knowledgable enough myself to find flaws in his reasoning either. But as I look further into the topic I'm finding more people that agree than disagree with him on his predictions.

2018-03-26 17:22:25,How can an investor expect 6-7% average returns from the market?,"First time poster here, let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.

My question is stated in the title, but I will explain further below. I was having a discussion with friends on how the average investor can expect 6-7% average returns in the stock market (per Warren Buffet).

The Dow averaged around 3000 in 1990. Today the market closed at 24,202. Has productivity and returns really increased 8x over the last 30 years? I feel like it's virtually impossible for the Dow to be at 192,000 in another 30 years.

My personal theory is that the only way for the market to continue increasing at this rate is two-fold. 1.) The United States must continue to print money and run a large deficit. The stock market price today would have been impossible 30 years ago because there was not enough money in circulation. 2.) The United States must maintain its position of dominance in the world, which lately has felt like not so much a sure thing. 

Can anyone give a logical explanation refuting my thinking? My thoughts haven't changed my investing plan, I am still maxing out my 401K into mostly stocks, but I would like to reduce my skepticism.",0,42

She made it very clear that scientific discovery is her first priority, saying ""there are some things which are much easier and efficient to develop and discover through a company than through a traditional university"" She said that she will be putting her efforts towards innovation first and investors second.

I'm saying this as a Biology major in university. The technology is amazing and world changing, but more in the area of research, it's not exactly marketable at this point. So if you're going to invest in NTLA, EDIT, or CRSPR at this point, just know that these companies don't really have value right now, you're betting on human psychology at this point, which is no better than crypto. 

Sure, it will have value one day, but the whole market is hyped up right now from people who don't know what's really going on within this industry. And also know that this industry is being led by people who care more about changing the world for the better than stuffing your bank accounts.

Everything that I had ever worked for, studied for, has been thrown away.

My partner was holding $150k of our money in an account 
I was holding $50k of assets that had appreciated over a few months.

I felt comfortable that the asset would no longer appreciate, & advised her we should sell the asset & just fund our education, & live comfortably for a year or two.

I had stressed that I wanted to move away from the asset 1 month prior,& was happy to know we had “made it”.

I advised her we should sell, this is the peak.
She refused.
I stressed that we would not see anything higher, this was a good exit point.
She refused, stating she believed we could go higher.
I stressed that we should really get out.

She refused.

I entertained her logic,& became optimistic. Maybe she was right.


She had no previous experience dealing in stocks, or appreciating assets. All she had was optimism.
I guess I wanted to believe the optimism.

Surely, we would see a new high.

I let go of my seatbelt I was ready to unbuckle from. And hung in there for the ride.

Not knowing when the bottom would be, but also nearing an announcement from the company-I couldn’t sell. I was stuck.

Here now I am.
3 months later.
90% of the money lost.
With bills exceeding $3000 a month.

I had studied years to get to this point.
I wanted to find my education, focus on finishing my degree...

Premise 1) Safe drinking water will be in shorter supply 

Premise 2) Land will be more expensive due to overpopulation/ land prices tend to rise. 

Premise 3) oil prices will rise- this will increase transport costs and hence contribute to increase in food costs. 

Not sure how tax cuts, higher debt (which we may not be able to repay), higher interest rates, will affect this trade. 

I don’t want to buy gold because it’s inherently worthless and it has value because people give it value. Might as well buy crypto if I’m going down that road. 

Hence, coconuts. However, it would be a difficult task to find a broker who will let me do this so might as well invest in wheat or soybeans or something. (Maybe avoid food produced in red state areas due to risk of tarrifs for China. But that’s only a short term problem so not really a concern). 

The reason I took coconuts is that it has a high water content and might be seen as an alternative to drinking water in the future for developing areas/ areas with water crisis.

Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel).",31,127

So Amazon is up like 40,000% in 15-20 years. It is still growing very strong like it's a startup IPO, thanks to a smart, determined business man in Mr.Bezos.  

Can this company go all the way to $350,000 per share like $BRK.A? We know the P/E is ridiculous but it never ceases to stop this train. 

With a quick calculation, Amazon can go to **$300,000/share** with the following outcome. 

- 10% a year over 56 years
- 15% a year over 38 years 
- 20% a year over 29 years

""Tesla bulls will argue that their production will rise to 5000 Model 3’s per week soon and, therefore, the stock will trade meaningfully higher. Given that the company lost $20,000 per Model S and X sold for roughly $100,000 each last year, due to the fact that it cost more to build, sell, service, charge and maintain these cars than they collected in revenue, as it is important to include all costs when evaluating a business, we predict it will impossible for Tesla to make a profit on a $35,000 to $50,000 car.

As anyone with automotive experience knows, profit margins are far higher on bigger, more expensive cars. Therefore, the faster Tesla makes Model 3’s, the more money they will lose.""

""e do not believe that this will be possible given their expected future losses, working capital and capital expenditure needs, lousy execution with the Model 3, falling demand for their somewhat stale Model S and Model X, tax rebates of $7,500 per car that will start going away shortly, impending competition from Jaguar, Mercedes, Porsche, BMW, Audi, etc., the credit rating downgrade by Moody’s to Caa+ while leaving the credit on watch for further downgrades (Caa+ is basically defined as impending default), the NTSB investigation into the accident caused by the “Full Self Driving” option that they collected $3000 for (which may create a class action lawsuit, fines and the disabling of the feature), the fact that they have had 85 letters and investigations back and forth with the SEC (a very unusual pattern), the fact that their three top finance executives (CFO, Chief Accounting Officer, and Director of Finance) have left the company over the last 18 months leaving huge amounts of awarded by unvested shares on the table, a highly suspicious pattern, and the fact that the company owes suppliers roughly $3 billion of unsecured payments, which could be “called” at any time, similar to a run on a bank.

If Tesla’s suppliers simply asked for their past invoices to be paid and to be paid in cash at the time of their next parts delivery, a likely outcome the worse Tesla’s balance sheet gets, it is clear that Tesla would need to file for protection from creditors. Further, the banks lending Tesla money cannot ignore the balance sheet. They have strict rules that regulators enforce about lending to companies with increasingly negative working capital.""

ZTO Express, a Chinese shipping and logistics company. ZTO Express says it is one of the largest express delivery companies in the world, in terms of total parcel volume in 2015. 


In 2015, the company had a total parcel volume of 2.95 billion. In comparison, UPS delivered an average of 18.3 million packages globally a day in 2015, which would translate to about 6.7 billion packages for the year, but not all would be considered express delivery.


$ZTO is currently growing its revenues at *about* 30% Y/Y; has no debt; and continues to expand its reach and contracts with companies like $JD and $BABA to keep up with the growing demand of China's booming e-Commerce sector.


I've been following and investing in this company for a little over a year now with a cost average of $13.94. I think it's *slightly* underpriced now, but I would consider it to be a long-term investment rather than a short, pump and dump.


So long as $BABA and $JD continue to perform, you can safely assume that $ZTO will grow at a similar rate. I like $ZTO because of the diversity it adds to my portfolio, and the GAAP transparency is much greater than those of said retailers.

2018-06-04 13:46:43,Lets talk about cryptocurrencies,"I was a bit reluctant to post this here since I have a feeling you guys don't like this topic, but then again it seems to me that this is the only sub where I can expect at least one intelligent response.

I'd like to believe I have a good technical background and understand how Bitcoin and other cryptos work and after closely examining the projects in this space it seems like, with the exception of Bitcoin, they offer no real use case. In addition, all this ""blockchain"" hype is pure buzzword with no real usage. Yes, there are things in the banking industry that can be made more efficient but using centralized databases would be much more reasonable and efficient. What is concerning is that many big companies are hyping this up and the technical managers seem to see big things for blockchain technology. Judging from history there were technically inferior things that the market still pushed forward so  juding things only from a technical perspective is not that useful.

On to the market situation.  There are now more than 1600 cryptocurrencies with a combined market cap of 330 B. The number of ICO sales in May topped last year's sale and there are projects that raised billions (!) of dollars without having any product, not to mention that the product they want to develop seem to have no valuable use or future potential.

What I do lack is market understanding and experience. Doing research, it seems to me that this whole mess is very similar to the dot-com bubble, although the (mis) understanding of the technology is much wider than in the dot-com era.  

So I was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on how you see this market playing out in the future? My hypothesis is that everything other than Bitcoin is currently useless and hence should be valueless. But I don't know how to model this situation in a profitable investment. 

Is it realistic to expect that in 5+ years, there will still be thousands of cryptocurrencies and people willing to trade them? What could be a potential catalysts to stop this expansion? Could you draw some parallels from similar phenomenons ? (please dont mention tulips)

My intuition is that anything but Bitcoin should eventually fail but there were many instances in the tech world when inferior solutions were far more successful and adopted than technically superior counterparts. (an example would be the DOS operating system vs Unix) 

So I would really be curious to hear how you guys see this thing play out in the long term. Can we expect big exchanges like Binance (raking in hundreds of dollars of yearly profit) simply disappearing once the dust settles? Or is it realistic to expect that this kind of market action (buying and selling useless coins) takes off in the long term?

EDIT. **I don't care if you agree with the presented view or if I am right or wrong about the crypto space. Rather, given my assumptions I would like the opinion of seasoned investors. How do you see this bubble playing out. Any parallels/use-cases tied to traditional markets are welcome**",1,98

So if I buy a hamburger today for a dollar, let it become mummified and then 10, 20 or 30 years down the line I sell it, wouldn't I be able to make a significant amount from it? 

Obviously, expecting 2000 dollars isn't necessarily realistic, but there must be *someone* interested in buying one for well over the original price so let's say 100 dollars a pop, if you sell 100 of them you would make like 10,000 dollars.",26,43

CD Projekt is a sincere gaming company heavily favoured by the entire gaming community, with a solid foundation in their gaming platform + track record of great, loved games (Witcher series).

In short, CD Projekt has: good games (sincere quality - no micro-transactions, e.g. loot boxes), a game distribution platform (GOG.com - DRM free steam competitor), and more good stuff. Downsides are obviously time in-between games, as well as heavy downside if a game is bad (low sales, wasted time). Current outlook is that Cyperpunk 2077, their next AAA game (last was Witcher 3), will be really good (game reviewers have dubbed their 55-min closed demo incredible), and I think that if they expand their team and shorten development timeline of new games (alternatively have multiple AAA's being developed at the same time), then they are worth way more than they are now, even without micro-transactions like Activision and EA has, and which they are hated for.

I think Jeff Bezos is very smart, it's hard to pin down an extremely obvious anti-trust issue for Amazon because it doesn't make that much a profit unlike Google, but rest assured that it constantly uses its market power to push out competitors.

Amazon recently came out with the Toshiba Fire TV.

Link 1: https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-50-inch-Ultra-Smart-LED/dp/B07D4FQB8S

Link 2: https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-43-inch-Ultra-Smart-LED/dp/B07D4F2P26

Scroll down to the review section

Now open the link of a TCL TV, a direct competitor of Amazon's Fire TV: https://www.amazon.com/TCL-40S305-40-Inch-1080p-Smart/dp/B01N2UQ43P/

Notice how ALL the top reviews for the TCL is one star, despite the fact that the proportion of one star is lower for TCL than both Fire TVs AND the proportion of 5 star reviews is higher.

Meanwhile ALMOST ALL of Fire TV's reviews are 5 star.

I think Amazon is waving the flag of consumer welfare while attempting to drive out competition. This is most obvious with prime services. You pay a fixed fee for a bundle of services with a lot of value. The value of that bundle is insane, but there is no way in hell it is profitable. A video subscription alone probably costs your entire prime membership to operate, but Amazon is willing to lose that money today because the more people transact through Amazon, the less people transact elsewhere, and eventually there won't be an ""elsewhere"" left.

Where is it getting the money? Through AWS. Google and Microsoft are actually competing rationally in the cloud space because both of them have profits to protect, so they are not just handing cloud services for free like candies. 

Bottom line, Amazon is stamping out competition.

 * Minimal expenses because I travel for work (beyond NYC taxes and $1400/mo rent)
 * Some student loans, though I've paid down about 20k worth this year: (~6k@ 5%, ~12k at 4.4, 3.4, 3.15)

I didn't have money growing up, so I don't really know what to do with it, and chucking **all of it** in a retirement account feels like a suboptimal strategy, esp. given the historic bull run we're on.

2018-07-22 10:11:52,In 20 years time the 2 largest publicly traded companies will most likely be in my opinion....,"If we had to make an educated guess about which two companies are likely to be the largest by market cap in the future (or at least given all reasonable assumptions very likely to be up there) personally I believe it will be Google and Amazon. 

And of course this post is not meant to be seen as something I am very sure about. In fact, any long term prediction is most likely going to be flawed. However, I think it is always nice to have a discussion and see what people think about these types of questions and specifically in regards to looking at which large/high growth companies are likely to have sustainable businesses and capabilities. 

**Google:** Seems to be doing some fascinating things in AI. They have multiple self contained teams fully focusing on AI such as DeepMind and Brain. When looking at Google it even seems that building better AI's has been a fundamental goal ever since the company was founded. Recent advances in speech recognition and other areas prove that Google is at the very forefront of this technology and given its multifaceted approach to development it is likely Google will be  able to found many uses for their AI tech.

**Amazon:** On the other hand look like they are increasingly winning the global battle for retail, IT infrastructure and increasingly consumer electronics (Alexa, Kindle, Fire TV). These markets are gigantic and if Amazon really does cement a dominant and lasting lead in 2 of 3, areas mentioned above, then surely it will continue to grow into the future.

What do you guys think? Do you agree?

Or do you think it is likely going to be a different company that does not currently exist?

2018-07-28 08:11:20,"If you thought the FB drop was bad, wait until everybody learns about what's been going on with Salesforce","Let's forget for a minute that going into this, $CRM was already the most atrociously overvalued company in the market. Who or whatever has pumped $10 Billion of fake value into this company over the last month or two is obviously insane.  GAAP earnings are being swept under the rug, and the accounting people are making up EPS numbers as they go.  

There is no justification for this kind of market cap ($110 Billion now?) for a company that literally has no appreciable assets, no reason for its customers to not switch to cheaper or better alternatives.  It should have flat to negative forecasting, not these baloney numbers it comes up with.  Whoever buys this stock as an investment obviously has NO EXPERIENCE WITH SOFTWARE.  Anybody who has worked in the industry knows: the more software you add to software, the bulkier and more complex and expensive it gets to manage.  You're not paying for the ""software"" you're paying for the ""service"" of waiting in line to get service.  Anybody using CRM is literally paying that company to manage its own unwieldy complexity.  Customers are paying what is probably a 50X premium for something that doesn't deserve a 50X premium.

On the balance sheet, its intangible assets are something like 40+ billion? That is NOT COUNTING SHAREHOLDER EQUITY.  Remember the accounting equation?  

""Assets = Liabilites + Owners' Equity""

The assets piece is being manipulated and false information is being presented to shareholders.  EPS numbers touted are not GAAP compliant; instead they are reporting past revenue as current revenue (accounting tricks), and forecasting future revenue based on that already false premise.  

Also look at its short-term debt obligations, which are already ridiculous (90-something percent of its intangibles).  And yet, it somehow manages to get way below market-rate loans courtesy of JP Morgan so it can do ""acquisitions"" of companies and pay the founders of those companies worthless stock. The CEO and executive insiders then proceed to dump hundreds of millions of dollars in stock per week.

2018-08-04 19:21:21,Life Changing Profits...the case for Uranium and UUUU,"In 2006 there was a bitcoin like rally in uranium and uranium stocks. UUUU went from $10 to $200 in one year. In 2011 there was another run taking UUUU from $6 to $66. I believe we are at such an inflection point again with some important differences that may well make this run dwarf those previous two.

Uranium has gone through a prolonged bear market. It is not untrue in the commodity space to claim that the cure for low prices is low prices and no where might this be more true than in uranium. Over this decade long bear market the number of producers or wanna be producers has shrunk from 900 to less than 40. There has been massive supply destruction to the point were actual deficits are on the horizon. Despite Fukushima there are more than 300 new reactors in some form of construction or planning, more than there were prior to Fukushima all the while supply of uranium has been in rapid decline. This is a simple arithmetic problem...no supply, increasing demand equals higher prices. Because of the nature of the uranium market there are no substitutes and real buying panics can ensue as utilities rush to the window to secure long term supplies. I think this is very likely to happen as it did twice since 2006 but given the lack of existing miners to meet this demand the price spike may well dwarf those previous two.

Add to this another entirely new dynamic.....The US has allowed itself to nearly lose its domestic supply of fuel to unfriendly foreign entities. We now have a national security issue where 20% of US electricity production is at risk of disruption. This is not going to stand. A section 232 has been filed on behalf of the few remaining US producers of uranium and I'm nearly 100% certain a remedy will be had giving US producers a quota of 25% of the domestic demand. How big this is cannot be overstated. With only a couple of existing US miners this means a $30 premium over global contract pricing and guaranteed business at many fold production increases. Enter UUUU

UUUU is what I would call a best of breed company. It is the largest, best capitalized, most experienced US based miner with capacity to produce 12 million lbs per year. They also are the only current producer of Vanadium in N. America...a mineral at an all time high price mind you. UUUU has the potential if all the stars align to regain those lofty stock prices in the near term...2-3 years and potentially exceed them. This truly is a life changing possibility that can add zeros to your net worth. 

UUUU is the only stock I would consider...it is best of breed and 1st in line to benefit from a section 232 passage and a renewed bull market in the commodity. I am definitely talking my book here as I have an extensive position in the company but I must add that it is because of my total conviction that something extraordinary is unfolding.

TLDR:
>Keep in mind that we’re not offering investment advice, but it is a very basic question that one would ask about any asset class, and we approach the question at the end of our study. When you invest in your retirement, Vanguard or whatever platform you use will suggest how to best allocate your portfolio. We did the same for cryptocurrency. If you as an investor believe that Bitcoin will perform as well as it has historically, then you should hold 6% of your portfolio in Bitcoin. If you believe that it will do half as well, you should hold 4%. In all other circumstances, if you think it will do much worse, then you should still hold 1%. Of course, one has to remember that, as with any other assets, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. Maybe cryptocurrency will completely change its behavior, but currently the market does not think it will.

In either case, even if one never ""understood"" the value of Bitcoin, arguably most average joe investors in traditional markets don't understand the value of their investments either, they're just following the advice of their financial advisors or following the wisdom of the crowd.

So what do you think it would take for either yourself or the mainstream opinion of experts and/or the general public to shift?

For an extreme example, if in 2080 we find that 98% of the world used Bitcoin for 98% of their transactions and 98% of their store of value for the last 100 years, and there were thousands of financial institutions and products built around it, it would obviously be well beyond the point where it was legitimate. Anyone who didn't think so at that point would be part of the lunatic fringe, as arguably most Bitcoiners are now. 

To be clear I'm not predicting that, I'm just saying no matter how against it you may be now, there has to be a line where being against it could no longer be a serious position. Where do you think that line is?",0,85

I turn 49 in about 1 month.  For reasons that i won't get into, my employability in engineering for big companies might be over.   I contracted on and off (mostly on) for big aerospace/defense/nasa-related companies for the last 20+ years.  My net worth is currently $1,045,000.... $390k (and growing) in retirement accounts..... $300k cash (half is invested in stocks and etfs)..... 2 houses that are paid off with a total value of about $355k (growing at maybe 2%/year)  that are both rented out (about $1500/month take home total after all expenses).  My current living arrangement has no living expenses (no rent. no utilities.  i won't explain this situation but it will last maybe 6 months to 1 year more).

I live in southern arizona near the mexican border.  I have free health insurance maybe for life (won't explain that either).  If that health insurance fails, there are well qualified doctors and dentists in mexico; you just have to shop and find a good one.   However, I am healthy and fairly athletic...  bicycle, hike, weight train.  don't smoke, no street drugs, quit drinking(for legal reasons).  At the moment, i rarely see doctors except for shrinks that i think i need.

I have no debt.

I don't spend lavishly, have flashy cars, etc.  I spend quite frugally (the dollar store is a virtual compendium of great deals!).  I love traveling but most of my domestic travel is road trips and sleep in the car (or a future small rv).

I completely and utterly dread the day my mom passes (I just almost cried just thinking about it) but i'm hoping she lives another 15 to 18 years at which i conservatively estimate i'll inherit maybe $150k.

I don't expect to retire completely.  Maybe i'll buy a couple more properties and be a landlord.

I figure I can retire now with this landlord plan but i dunno.

Wondering what others ( maybe who have been retired for awhile) think of this plan?  is it stupid? is it feasible? i know there are a lot of variables to consider.

Thank you.

My view: To the well educated investor, options are a legitimate asset class that can be used to both hedge and create positions that add an extra layer of protection to a well diversified portfolio. However, the vast majority of retail investors are not versed enough in the markets to make such a calculated decision, and the purchase of such an asset for most is tantamount to gambling. The inclusion of these assets on retail investing platforms is antithetical to the investing philosophy of long-term, sustained growth of one's portfolio, and the inclusion and legitimization of options ultimately does a disservice to customers when considering the customer's long term well-being.

2018-10-19 10:45:54,History’s Longest Bull Market About to Crash?,"  

David Rosenberg thinks this bull market is a sham.

In his [Wednesday interview with CNBC’s “Trading Nation,”](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/23/longest-bull-market-on-record-is-cracking-bear-david-rosenberg-warns.html) he warned that this record-breaking bull market (it’s the longest in history as of August) paired with the weakest economic expansion of all time has only been possible thanks to the flood of cheap money from central banks. 

He’s predicting that first we’ll see pain in the corporate bond market, where rising rates will put severe pressure on a handful of companies that turn out to be the canaries in the coal mine for what’s ahead.

And he’s not alone.

Last month, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Michael Hartnett proclaimed the “Great Bull” market is over – and he also blamed rising rates.

Of course, with a record 3,453 days without a 20% correction, this market can’t keep making history forever. 

We all know there will be a reckoning – but when?

One thing to keep in mind is that staying out of the markets can actually be more expensive than staying in.

Say it’s January 1999 and you have $10,000 to invest.

But it’s a scary time to be pondering an entry into markets. The Dow is up 25% from last year alone. Since three years ago, it’s up an amazing 111%.

So you’re too late, right? Grab a bull by the horns and you’ll end up gored?

Not so simple. From January 1999 to January 2000, the Dow returned another 25%. A simple index fund, even at that late stage of the bull market, would have turned your $10,000 into $12,500.

Of course, a handful of companies did a lot better in the last leg of that bull market.

Just think – from January 1999 – 2000, Qualcomm returned an amazing 2,487%. Even Apple, which was mired in a disastrous turnaround in the late ‘90s, nearly tripled investors’ money from 1999-2000.

If you’d looked at the toppish-seeming markets, and took a pass on putting your $10,000 into them – you could have lost a lot more than $10,000, just by forfeiting potential upside.

Of course, hindsight is 20/20 as the cliché goes.

But the parallels between today’s markets and the Dot.com mania are hard to ignore – both the lessons on risk AND reward. 

And even if you disagree with [this analyst that a stock market “Melt Up” is just beginning to ramp up ](https://orders.stansberryresearch.com/chain?cid=MKT376375&eid=MKT385086&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=start#AST90728) \-- you can’t deny that 2018’s biggest winners so far (tech stocks are leading the charge, with Netflix alone up 68% for the year so far) look a lot like 1999’s tech-heavy list of frontrunners that multiplied investors’ money back then, too.

Again – the bull market has to end. But it doesn’t have to end tomorrow, or even 18 months from now.

And in the meantime, who do you think will look smarter when it’s over? People who got out today… or people who ramped up their tech investments (and keep risk management like trailing stops in mind) – while they ride their winners into the sunset like it’s 1999?

2018-10-27 08:48:40,The U.S. Secretly Halted JPMorgan’s Growth for Years [Bloomberg],"For almost six years, Washington secretly shackled JPMorgan Chase & Co., the nation’s biggest bank.

Now the chains are off, thanks to bank-friendly regulators in the Trump administration.

In actions never before made public, Obama administration regulators prevented the bank from opening branches in new states as punishment for violating banking rules, according to people familiar with the matter. JPMorgan’s ambitious plan to expand nationally, announced earlier this year, was made possible by the Trump administration’s rollback of those restraints, which date from 2012, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing regulators’ impact on the bank’s plans.

JPMorgan has racked up more than $30 billion in penalties, legal costs and related obligations since the 2008 financial crisis, some of which stemmed from its acquisitions of Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc. Missteps include excessive risk taken by the London Whale trader and failing to flag transactions related to Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Privately, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency stopped JPMorgan from expanding into additional states while resolving compliance breakdowns as part of an unwritten regulatory policy, the people said.

Expansion Ban
While banks often have private conversations with regulators and even gauge their reactions to potential plans, the people with knowledge of the matter described the ban as one of the more extreme ways they exerted their control behind the scenes.

Regulators went to even harsher lengths earlier this year to punish Wells Fargo & Co., placing a cap on its assets after a pattern of lapses and abuses. Janet Yellen, who served as Federal Reserve chair under President Barack Obama, announced the unprecedented punishment on her final workday in office.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, operated 5,130 branches in 23 states at the end of last year. With fresh assurances from regulators under President Donald Trump, the people said, it’s planning to open 400 branches in as many as 20 new markets in the next five years, including plans to build in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. This is the first time the bank is opening branches in a new state in more than a decade. The moves could translate into an additional $1.5 billion of revenue a year by 2022, according to Morgan Stanley.

‘Extremely Excited’
“We are extremely excited to be expanding again, as smart regulatory policy and a competitive corporate tax system help us to deliver on our commitment to invest in our customers and communities,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Oct. 12.


Jamie DimonPhotographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg
JPMorgan has resolved many of its compliance issues, but the OCC still has open enforcement actions against the bank, according to agency data.

Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank wouldn’t comment on supervisory issues.

“Opening new branches is a sustainable and long-term investment in the communities we serve,” Gray said. “Entering new markets will bring the full force of JPMorgan Chase’s business and philanthropic capabilities, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and allow us to serve more customers and local businesses by lending and investing in their community.”

OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard declined to comment.

New Branches
In loosening their grip on JPMorgan, authorities removed a critical barrier to the lender’s growth. A 1994 law prohibits mergers between banks if the transaction would give any of them control of more than 10 percent of U.S. deposits. With $1.3 trillion, JPMorgan already controls more than 10 percent -- second only to Bank of America Corp. -- which means adding branches in new markets is one of its only avenues for expansion.


Joseph OttingPhotographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg
The reversal comes amid anti-regulatory fervor under Trump. It’s also consistent with the declared willingness of the new OCC head, Joseph Otting, to give financial institutions more flexibility when resolving concerns raised by OCC staff. Otting worked closely with future Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at OneWest Bank, now part of CIT Group Inc., when the lender came under fire for its mortgage-servicing business.

The OCC has softened its approach to overseeing banks from the aggressive tone under Thomas Curry, who led the agency from 2012 to 2017. Curry instituted tough standards in an effort to change the perception that regulators were too close to the institutions they were meant to police.

Relaxed Stance
Banks are responding to friendlier regulators under Trump by pushing into new markets and reassessing deals that likely would’ve been vetoed under Obama. Many elected officials and policymakers blamed reduced oversight for the 2008 financial crisis, which triggered the longest and deepest recession since the 1930s.

One person familiar with JPMorgan’s plans said regulation was only partly to blame for JPMorgan not broadening its consumer bank in the decade after the crisis. The bank constantly evaluated ways to expand the consumer bank, but executives were hesitant due to the cost and difficulty, the person said.

JPMorgan is embarking on the biggest expansion of its consumer bank in a decade as new liquidity rules encourage banks to draw more funding from deposits, which tend to be cheaper, and rising interest rates stiffen the competition for retail customers. Bank of America also announced plans to open up branches in new markets earlier this year.

“I’ve been waiting to do this for 10 years,” Dimon said in September.

I have read a version of this statement over and over on financial message boards and articles about investing.

Yes, in the past the stock market always came back but are you at least 90% convinced that this will happen after the next bear market (stock market crash)?  Maybe it will just sit there for years and years at the low number.  Or it will continue to fall.  Just because the market came back in the past does not mean it will in the future.

Maybe that 3.5% CD I saw advertised may be a good idea after all!

SOMETHING TO CONSIDER:  A continued bad stock market was a overwhelming fear by early 2009. By February 2009, the stock market had dropped 56% and there was really no sign it would ever go up again.  This was after a really bad period from September 2008-to February 2009 when the stock market dropped 45% in just 5 months.  If you asked most people in February 2009 if the stock market would come back, like it always did, they would have said no.

What will people think about the stock market going back up after the crash of late 2019 when the market drops 60% due to a global recession and trade war?  Your thoughts?

I searched how to investing for 6 months by internet, read books, and YouTube videos

However, I couldn't find any helpful information during 6 months.

Every internet blogs or posts just tell me obvious things and YouTube videos were same. 

&#x200B;

To learning investing I took Accounting and Finance class in my high school and asked my business teacher too 

But I still don't get it and I don't even know where should I start it 

Could you guys give me any advice for me?

2018-11-05 07:21:17,Apple - the most undervalued company in the world?,"Not only is the company the most valuable company in the world, but I would argue it's the most undervalued company. Why? Because it's the most misunderstood business out there? 

Let me explain. For anyone who tuned in to the earnings call last week, or read the news related to it, are aware of the reporting bomb Apple dropped - it will stop reporting unit sales for all products. Instead it will provide revenue and cost for each individual product line. This took everyone by surprise - and Wall St doesn't like surprises. 

In the aftermath the stocks plunged 7% (partly due to underwhelming rev. forecast for holidays) and a lot of bashing in media outlets. Sentiment out there is negative since the belief is that slowing growth of unit sales is main reason for dropped unit sales. This is where I believe everyone is wrong. 

Apple has evolved tremendously since it launched the iPhone. Back then the company had one color and few memory options. Today, several generations of iPhones are available in various configurations. The story is the same for iPad. During the years more wearables, accessories have been introduced along with services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, iCloud etc.). My feeling is that the company now views it's eco-system as complete in some way. It has entry products, high-end (as always), up/cross-sales (EarPods, Watch, Pencil etc.) after-sales monetization (services) - basically everything needed to look at customers as a installed base that it needs to grow and monetize over time. In very simple terms - X amount of customers * Y amount of revenue/customer. I believe this is the only metrics the company is focusing on growing from now on - customer base and revenue per customer. That's why they don't care if they sell you an iPad after the iPhone or EarPods and a watch. 

Coming to this conclusion, I think Apple is fundamentally misunderstood and needs to be re-valued - as a service-business. I think Apple shall not be looked at as a hardware maker (Ford or GM) but rather as a social network (Facebook). Sure, the business is different but the metrics shouldn't be. Facebook tracks monthly active users and revenue per user. I believe this is how Apple will/should do it. Looking at businesses with a common approach - they're valued way more than P/E 17. Facebook, after a recent slaughter, is roughly P/E 22. Google is P/E 40. 

This official shift in how the company wants analysts and investors to view it (I am sure the company has been viewing itself this way for a while) makes me very bullish on the future of the company. I believe this will mitigate a future of ""hardware saturation"" since the company is anticipating that and constantly figuring out ways to squeeze out more money per customer. 



EDIT: An article in Stratechery was just posted related to this topics. Think this might help to understand my thinking - which seems to be in line with the author's. https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-social-network/",0,67

2018-11-09 02:08:40,In a flat market like this you can clearly see how much money the bank is taking from you,"This happened to me in 2015/2016 as well.

In a flat market like this, you can see quite clearly how much money your financial institution takes from you.   

Rising markets like 2017 tend to hide the 'theft' and if you have a 401(k) which gets additional deposits every pay period, that can hide the 'theft' too.

But in a market which is flat all year, like this year, you will notice that your money is mysteriously down by three percent.   i.e.  if you had 100,000 at the beginning of the year, at the end you will have 97,000.

What happened?

Where did the three percent go?

(a) Expense Ratios.  Advisors like to hide your money in ""funds"" and each fund takes away a fraction of your money, ""expense ratios"", so that Wall Street people can keep getting their multimillion dollar salaries.  The expense ratios are usually around 0.8 or 0.9 percent but can go as high as 1.5 percent.

(b) Active-management fees.  Yes, you knew this when you signed the documents, the banker himself takes from 1 to 1.5 percent of your money, for all that ""work"" he has to do buying the aforementioned funds, which can be done with three mouseclicks if you have access to the right screen.

It makes sense that iphones sales should increase massively with 5G since everyone will want to upgrade.

2018-11-20 11:09:54,Advice for staying calm?,"Hi guys. I've only been investing for a little over a year. Before that I had done investing in a stock investing simulator and had made about 10% in about 2 months. 

A friend introduced me to Robinhood and I've  been investing for over a year now. I don't have much to invest seeing as how I'm a recent graduate and haven't been working for too long. First few months it was pretty good slow gains, at the height I had about $1000 in gains. 

Lately it's gotten worse, I've always had a few stocks that were failures , losing me maybe $100 at the most. But most of my major investments have been in technology stocks especially FAANG. For a while was doing well and even made some short term trades and gains (couple hundred not much). Then as the market kept dropping I kept thinking it was a good opportunity to keep buying these stocks at a low price.  

Well... You've seen what's happened to the FAANG stocks this week... I've lost over $2000 total, the most I've ever lost. Mostly from Amazon. The thing is I know eventually these stocks will go back up again and I'll make a profit on them if I sell. But taking such huge losses right now frustrates me and knowing I could've gotten those stocks at significantly lower prices bothers me too. 

My question for all the experienced traders out there is how do you stay calm and not worry?
Also should I start buying more? These stocks have hit their 52 week lows and I doubt will not be this cheap in a while ( though that was my thought a few weeks ago , turns out it did keep dropping...) 

Thanks for advice and suggestions

Edit: Some additional points I want to address. I have some prior knowledge and experience on this. I've taken economic and business courses. I have read a book on economic bubbles but perhaps I could read some more about investing in general. 

When I talked to my Bank's financial advisor he said that since I was younger I should put most of my investments in stocks of well established companies like the FAANG stocks that are bound to grow over time. And then on the safe side invest in S & P and just let it grow over time.

2018-11-21 18:10:31,Don't expect a crash,"I have seen so many posts/comments recently saying the market is obviously overvalued, we're 'due' for a crash, it is not a good time to buy the dip etc. I don't know where the crystal balls have come from!

First of all, some of the greatest companies are already down 20-40%, expecting another 20-40% seems overzealous. Nobody knows how things will turn out - we could make a China deal, we could never cut a deal. Interest rates might be raised 5 times in 2019 they might not. Google or Apple or Amazon or someone else could roll out paradigm shifting technology in 3 years that fundamentally changes productivity, or they might not. 

I bought some AMZN yesterday because it was 25% of highs. I'm going to buy all my Christmas presents on AMZN like I always do, watch Netflix tonight which basically runs on AWS, go to work next week and run models on AWS EC2 instances. AMZN just rolled out plans for new HQs obviously they feel good about the future. My plan if we do continue dropping is DCAing a S&P500 index fund.

2018-11-24 00:24:51,Saving $120k / year as renters to $13k / year as single income homeowners,"Hello, I am wondering if I could get some financial advice. I apologize for the long post, but I want to make sure I give enough context.

Right now, my girlfriend and I make about **$260k per year** and we live in **Los Angeles, CA**. We are both **34 years old**.

Below is a summary of our current financial situation.

&#x200B;

$594k	Savings Account (2%)

$75k 	401k

$63k	Traditional IRA

$33k	Roth IRA

$113k 	Beneficiary IRA

**878K 	TOTAL SAVINGS**

\----------------------------

$260k 	Gross Income (I make $150k she makes $110k)

$45k	Annual Expenses (Housing only makes up $7k/year of that expense)

	

We made some sacrifices to have a low rent right now. However, if we **buy a house** it will increase our Annual Expenses considerably and we will be saving a lot less. So, **instead of** **$7k/year** on housing it will **jump up to $42k-$54k/y ($3,500 - $4,500 /m principal, interest, property taxes, insurance, utilities, etc ).** This is assuming we get a reasonably priced home given the 4.5-5% interest rates and with no HOA. Los Angeles has high housing costs so a basic home can be **600k**but the move-in ready homes are closer to **800k**. So, we are assuming a house cost between those price ranges.

So, based on this increase of housing costs our Annual Expenses would then become $87k - $99k per year. If we are both working at $260k / year this seems ok and we'd still be saving between $68k-80k per year. However, if we have a kid and say we go **single income** (for her to raise the kid) then we would be saving only $1k-13k per year.

  
Based on this, I have a few questions:  


**1. Since we have a solid amount of liquid cash ($600k) how should we allocate it right now to help us plan for retirement?**

For example, we can put a large payment down so that we have a small monthly payment, continue to cashflow, and continue to save cash to invest elsewhere (retirement, real estate, stocks, et.). However, this means we are not leveraging our money. The other thought is we put down only 20% meaning we have a larger payment to pay every month, save A LOT less cash, but will be able to put more of our current cash into investments right now. If the latter is the case, then how would we allocate the remainder of the $600k after the downpayment?

**2. How can I find out the minimum amount we need to save each year to hit retirement between 45-55?**

Saving $13k per year on a single income doesn't seem like it would help us get to retirement until like 65+. I plan pretty conservatively so I'm trying to figure out, if we bought a house based on a single income how much would we need to save each year to hit an earlier retirement between ages 45-55.",0,13

2018-12-05 16:06:48,AAPL dropping 25% is actually the BEST thing for long term investors.,"Full disclosure: AAPL is by far my biggest holding. Been holding shares since 2008, but it didn't become a significant portion of my portfolio till 2012.

I'm actually happy that AAPL has drop 25%.  I actually would not mind it dropping down to $150.  Why?  Because at $233 it seemed to be running out of air and just running mainly on momentum/hype.

But more importantly a lower share price will allow AAPL to buy a ton of shares at great prices.  Apple has about $250 billion in cash.  Last year Apple generated $75 billion in free cash flow from operations.  The CFO has already announced that AAPL will go cash neutral. Meaning they will spend all their cash up to the amount of debt they carry. So the next 5 years Apple could buyback $400-$500 billion in stock.  

The longer the stock price is low, the more shares AAPL can buy.  

If the price stays below $200 for the next 2-3 years they could easily buyback another 25-30% of the shares. 

Its pretty great.

When solid stocks drop people say buy the dip or dollar cost average.  The great thing is with Apple the company itself is buying the dip for me with out me risking any more capital!  I love it.",5,140

[USA demographics pyramid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Uspop.svg/800px-Uspop.svg.png)

1.  Demographics shift affecting capital markets & retirement crisis.  The largest and wealthiest segment of the population is the baby boomers.  The majority of them reached retirement age 2 years ago.  After 2008 devastated their retirement accounts, many of them realized that they don't have enough to retire, so they made riskier investment than they normally should have.  Artificially raising the stock market and lowering the cost of capital.  This bear market and recession, will devastate them further, and many wont be able to retire at all.  So what do they do?  Sell the house, and move to cheaper lodgings.  Well, if everyone does that at the same time?  Home prices crash, especially since millenials don't make enough to pay the asking price.  I would not be surprised to see a 50% fall in home values.

2.  Student debt.  Young people from age 20-35 are traditionally the ones that buy homes, cars, and all the big life purchases.  This age bracket is what fuels a consumption based economy. Currently, this age bracket is loaded with too much student debt, which is not dischargable in bankruptcy, to do any of the above.  So we're not gonna be able to spend our way out of a recession.  

3.  There aren't enough gen-xers to fill out the tax paying bracket.  The majority of income tax comes from people aged 40-65.  These people are further in their careers and making more money, therefore more income tax.  There just aren't enough gen-xers to pay the same level of taxes that the government needs to operate with all of the existing entitlement programs.  This is gonna blow a huge hole in government finances.  

4.  Corporate debt.  Since 2008, interest rates have been crazy low, allowing companies to borrow ""free money"", and then they used that money to buy back their stock and artificially raise their stock price, netting their executives hefty bonuses.  Interest rates rise, they have to pay back the loans, but a recession & bear market cuts 30% off their stock value right from the start.  Where is that debt payment money going to come from?

5.  Government debt.  we're at $21trillion and counting.  We've run out of people to borrow money from, and the rest of the world will be dealing with their own financial crises.

6.  Global financial depression.  Germany, China, and Japan each depend on exports for over 30% of their GDP.  If the US is in recession, who is gonna buy their goods?  

7. The EU is going to collapse.  This is why Merkel stepped down now.  Cause she doesn't want to be holding the reigns when shit hits the fan.  [European demographics](http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/images/2011/Oct/Fourplex_demographics_1600.jpg) are way worse than Americas.  They are not going to be capable of consumption-fueled growth for at least 30 years.  There are no young people to pay taxes to fund the retirement of the old people.  They just aren't there.  So those pensions that the boomers were counting on, wont be z

8. Italy and the rest of the southern European countries joined the EU for access to Germany's credit card, and then they elected a series of politicians who bought elections by guaranteeing social programs, instead of using those loans to modernize their economy and infrastructure.  So now, you've got tons of debt, empty promises, and non-competitive economies.  Italy's debt is at $2.2 trillion, 15% of which is bad standing, and that's AFTER the EU redefined the rules for rating debt.  Italy doesn't have the demographics to be able to grow its economy, so they wont be able to repay that debt.  

We could deal with any 2 or 3 of these, but all of them?  At the same time?  At the same time as a recession and stock market crash?  No way Jose....  And I didn't even mention automation and AI.....

My current position.  I pulled out of the market entirely 6 months ago.  I'm holding 5-10% in precious metals, and the rest in cash.  Cause I want to be able to pick up some sweet deals on assets when the dust starts to settle in two years +/-.  There's gonna be a lot of blood in the streets, and I'm gonna buy property.  


TLDR:  Putting this all together, we have a bear market, a recession, a fundamental and game-changing shift in demographics, a retirement crisis, too many young people in debt, and not enough gen-xers to pay the majority of income tax.  And that's just America.  The next 10 or so years, are gonna be rough.

Multiply that by the70 million-plus U.S. users whose data was compromised by the personality-quiz app at stake in the Cambridge scandal, and you’re looking at $2.9 trillion and change.

I would like to start a discussion and hopefully compile a list of comparatively ethical investing options including stocks, bonds, funds and other. As this is an financial investing forum I'm referring to options still able to produce financial interest in the long term rather than charity. 
I fully realize that we can't all agree on what an ethical investment is, but hopefully we can pick out some that do less harm than others. 

For example, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, L’Oréal are some companies that are more or less are universally considered unethical. 

Meanwhile companies like Adobe and ON Semiconductors have been mentioned as ethical by several lists and sources. 

When it comes to countries I would avoid bonds from ones actively warmongering, defying human rights or severely polluting. 

So, please, mention several options you yourself consider ethical, and if you want, some that you absolutely would avoid.

2019-01-03 22:06:42,Apple is going to go into a huge decline here. Iphone in 2019 is like PC industry in 2009.,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSYBtoTcxTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSYBtoTcxTY)

&#x200B;

Smart phones are about 10 years behind desktop computers in terms of performance. Remember the first iphone in 2007? It was \~300mhz which was the speed of a pentium2 top-of-the-line desktop computer in 1997. If you look at the numbers you will find that this pattern roughly holds across many variables (memory capacity, gpu performance, cpu performance, etc.) . The  first 1ghz CPUs arrived in 2000. First 1ghz smart phone? 2010.

&#x200B;

1997->2007 was a period of rapid increases in desktop and laptop capability. Because of the huge speed gains, people rushed to upgrade every 2-3 years triggering huge sales and a boom for many companies like Dell, HP, etc.  replacement cycles were very short in this time period. In 1997 it might have been as low as 2 years! This hugely inflated sales numbers.

&#x200B;

2007 and 2008 were turning point years for desktop computers. It was clear then that the pace of improvement had slowed way down. 

&#x200B;

Over time the replacement cycle steadily increased. This really became noticeable in the late 00's around 2009-2010. Computer capability simply was not getting that much better every year by then so replacement cycles skyrocketed. People started holding on to desktops and laptops for 5+ years. This caused the industry to go into decline in 2011 and only recently came out of that.

&#x200B;

I believe 2017 and 2018 were turning point years for smart phones. My personal phone (an iphone) was built in 2017 and I really have no plans to upgrade near term. How much better is the new one over a 2017 model? 20%? Is that worth $1000? I used to upgrade my phone yearly.

&#x200B;

I think the 10 year difference will hold here. Replacement cycles are going to start skyrocketing and the industry will go into decline for a while just as the PC industry did.

&#x200B;

Buying apple here is like buying DELL or HP back in 2009 but without the upside of selling to the corporate and server markets. Dell at least could sell servers to the booming web services economy. Apple is purely consumer. 

&#x200B;

I suspect Apple is trying to stave off this decline by jacking up prices which they have done in the past year. This might back fire triggering an even faster spike in replacement cycles.

&#x200B;

Apple could easily fall another 50% from where we are today. Steer the hell away from this name.

I’m not going to stop but I have no one in my family going as far as I am and pushing quite so hard. If I try to vent with them there is not relation. So please don’t hate me for telling some of my story and venting some stress, because I’m pushing so god damn hard and it never fucking stops.

So about 2 and. Half years ago I was almost bankrupt I had just left the military I did not know how much income bills took. So I was shockingly supprized when it was hard to live when 75 percent of all income came went to debt. Instead of going bankrupt I decided to bunker down. I went into sales made enough to pay the debt lived with family cause anything else was impossible, I got a second job payed off all that debt in 1.5 years and haven’t been in debt sense and very happy. And sense I’ve been out of debt I’ve been focusing on building assets. My first goal is buying a duplex cash by the age of 26 which I am on tract for. Unfortunately I had to move from my parents home. Good for them my mom got promoted and moved to another state, I didn’t want to move from my fiancé though so I chose to move closer to her in Milwaukee. At first I chose to live in the hood to save, living was cheap all bills added up to 700 then anything left was mine for investing. I got a death threat because of my skin color a few months ago and because of my rediculas sense of responsibility and no excuse attitude towards my goals and dreams I have chosen to live in my car and save more instead of fine another place to rent, I am in engineering school for a great university here using my GI Bill and working full time and managing all of this is so fuckingdamn stressful. Between me and my fiancé we save rediculas amounts a year, but every night I go to bed when it is cold specially once it starts getting negative temps I know I am starring death in the face for my dreams. And it’s just so tiring going through the fucking grind man I am eather sleeping in a cold as fucking car studying my life off for one of the hardest degrees out there or working and if I have anything left it goes delightfully to my fiancé. But fuck man I’m just so exhausted and I am not willing to back down eather but it really fucking sucks having only one person to vent to I dont have friends cause everyone I know wants to party and isn’t concerned with making an impact on there future I get along with 50 year olds that own businesses and have family’s it is very hard to make friends here specially in that category because all of my time is taken from work school fiancé and managing my car situation, Idk it’s just frustraighting. As of now I have 11 months untill I get my first duplex in a working class area. Man I can’t wait I am seriously almost in tears just thinking about what it will be like to own it free and clear.  

Could someone maybe tell me there success story to give me some inspiration for some energy, like I said in the title I don’t want pity I just wanted to vent out loud because of lack of relatable relationships in my life.  But I love to hear other people’s storys and how they became successful. It really lights me up!

Most of our indicators are on buy signals, and we could envision this rally continuing into month-end, at least. But the S&P SPX, +1.32% chart remains bearish, and since that is the most important indicator, it is a warning sign not to become complacent.

The SPX chart shows the index is still in a downtrend. The pattern of lower highs and lower lows beneath a declining 200-day Moving Average continues to exist, and that is bearish. There is support at 2,350 (December lows), and SPX broke through the 2,600 resistance level on Wednesday but is already falling back below that level today. The last “high” on the chart was near 2,800, so if this rally culminates anywhere below that, the pattern of lower highs will be intact.

Me? I tend to be a gradualist. Small percentage moves and not all that often. Schiller PE 10 or CAPE is one metric. Buffet's GDP to market cap and the yield curve are two more.

Some less popular indicators include the Market Vane and AAII sentiment surveys. Anecdotal interest or lack of interest at social gatherings isn't at all scientific, but has given some of the best signals. This is the proverbial shoe shine boy indicator.

The story is that Joe Kennedy got a stock tip from his shoe shiner. He took that as a massive sell signal, and supposedly escaped the 1929 crash.

Technical indicators such as breadth, new highs vs new lows, above or below the 50 day and 200 day moving averages are some more. How the market reacts to news is yet another thing I look at.

A system that is never allowed to price in bad news for more than a few days is doomed to bubble toward infinity. Too urgent is the reflexive impulse to intervene, too desperate is the realization the economy is only one risk-off event away from a recession.""

...

> ""Not only did the Fed kill off its credibility, it also looks to have overtly caved to President Trump’s public twitter demands to stop rate hikes and the “50Bs”. Trump demanded and Powell delivered. So much for backbone. None. Whether the Fed admits it or not the perception is awful. They caved to political and market pressure.""

2019-02-10 18:17:50,Example of how wealth creation works.,"Below is an obvious oversimplification, but it’s a simple concept to illustrate how wealth is created and compounds. 

Imagine a world with 100 people who each produce and consume one apple every year. If someone invents a way to double output and takes half of everyone's second apple they become obscenely wealthy (50 apples a year). Still, everyone is much better off. 

Now that it's easier to produce the one apple needed, everyone can spend a portion of their time working on something else. Maybe even faster apple production methods or something unrelated to apples, like medicine or entertainment. 

This is how wealth creation compounds. 

Obviously the world world is much more complex than this example, but these are basic building blocks to build on top of. Filter out any ideas that require rejecting these fundamentals",6,28
2019-02-10 19:04:09,24 y/o looking for the best option to invest my savings to make good money rightaway.,"Hello folks, so I have more $15k+ in savings and I don't feel good about it. I'm always thinking on a good way to invest it.

To tell more about myself; I live and work as a cs graduate in a 3rd world country with little expenses and I would love to receive nice instant returns, I hate waiting
:(.

There's a nice option in my country where I buy a car and rent it as an Uber. The renter would pay around $170 weekly but it will have some legal implications or issues in a future. For example if the renter steals the car or crashes it. So it could be a headache.

Other options I have been thinking of are: crypto, Forex and maybe real estate. Problem with real estate is that I live in a 3rd world market, have probably little money to start and got no mentors.

2019-02-11 23:29:49,Asset allocation for a debt apocalypse,"Clearly the United States is on an unsustainable debt trajectory with deficits and debt growing every year.  Interest rates have nowhere to go but sideways or higher.  It seems likely the United States will never be able to pay off it's debts.  Also, the worldwide debt load is staggering as well when you add sovereign and corporate debt.  

&#x200B;

What's going to happen in the next recession?  The likely scenario seems to involve a lot of defaults both sovereign and corporate.  The United States is considered the safest paper on the planet because the Fed can print money to pay off the debt.  Of course that comes with consequences like a weakening dollar and higher inflation theoretically.  

&#x200B;

What do you think?  Do you foresee a coming debt apocalypse within the next 5-10 years?  If so, how do you allocate your money in such a scenario to prepare.  I have a rather large portfolio of stocks and bonds and right now it is approximately 60/30/10 other.  What would be a good allocation to partially hedge for a potential debt apocalypse?  I wish to stay fully invested at all times except no more than 10%-20% cash.   Most people say to move to bonds in a recession but if people are defaulting left and right I don't think that's the place to be.  And if the FED starts printing money than inflation will kill returns.  Of course stocks will get killed in a nightmare scenario.  Is gold the answer?  To be honest, I hate gold and gold bugs but this sort of chaos seems to be what gold is good for.

Of course, I may be wrong and the world marches happily on.  In this case, I'd still like to have some stocks and bonds.  What is the best allocation to preserve wealth in a worst case scenario?   ",1,20

The 2018 Tesla Model 3 was reportedly headed  southbound at the time that a tractor-trailer, pulling out of a driveway  leading to Pero Family Farms after stopping at a stop sign, attempted  to turn left onto the highway headed northbound. 

At that time the tractor-trailer entered the path of the Tesla, and  the latter hit the driver’s side of the trailer, “resulting in the roof  being sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer,” the report said.  The 50-year-old Tesla driver died on the scene, per Reuters. It is not  clear whether the Tesla’s Autopilot mode was active at the time of the  collision.

Per the police report, the Tesla Model 3 continued for  nearly a third of a mile before coming to a complete stop. As several  reports have noted, the incident bears remarkable similarities to [another fatal crash](https://gizmodo.com/fatal-tesla-crash-proves-full-autonomy-is-the-only-solu-1782923424) involving a Tesla Model S that occurred in Florida in 2016.""

2019-03-22 14:00:17,Potential US Recession Looming,"The bond market is flashing its biggest recession sign since before the financial crisis.


One of the most closely watched predictors for recession just sent an alarm signal. It's what investment pros call the ""yield curve,"" and it flipped on Friday for the first time since 2007 during the Great Recession.


This particular indicator lies within the bond market, where investors show how confident they are about the economy by how much interest they're demanding from U.S. government bonds. Typically, short-term debt yields less interest than long-term debt. But today that reversed.


With this in mind and with global growth slowing, particularly in China and Europe it’s important to not act out with emotion and irrationally (i.e. pull all of your investments and take a potential loss).


Remember: Warren Buffett has a saying about the stock market and investing in general: ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" This is a lot easier to say than act on.

People worry about the ghost cities in china but with the rise of the internet people can spread out further and further and with a population of 1.2 billion people there will be affordable housing for all chinese citizens in the near future.

This means that  more of the money people earn can be spent on things other than housing. Also in asian cultures it is very normal to live w family until marriage.

2019-05-15 19:37:55,Things I've learned trading options for the past few months,"So for the past 6 months or so I’ve tried my hand had trading simple puts/calls options on Robinhood, and I want to pass on what I’ve learned so perhaps someone new to options can get a head start. \*Disclaimer: I’m in no way endorsing or advocating trading options. If that scares you, please click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment). In all my trades, I’ve only made a few hundred bucks with a total amount of trade money equaling under $1000.

Before you get started, it’s important to know that the trading of options is essentially gambling; it’s almost pure speculation on whether or not the market or stock will go up or down and your bets will pan out. I  say almost because there are traders out there who make a consistent living doing options trading. This post is not for those who already know the in’s and out’s of options trading or are looking for information about advanced options trading strategies (spreads etc). But back to gambling… if you have a tendency to let emotions get control of you if you *win or lose,* or if you’ll hurt yourself or your family because one of your trades goes the wrong way, then stay out of options trading. I won’t go into all the other investment vehicles you can use to safeguard your money for retirement, and at a bare minimum,  don’t even think of trading options if you don’t first have an IRA/401k AND emergency fund of several thousand dollars.

I’m in no way endorsing trading of options as a retirement vehicle. If you trade options, you may lose everything you have in your bank in one week if you’re not careful.  Trading options can be stressful and painful when things don’t go your way. You really do have to watch your puts and calls pretty much every minute of the day while your trades are active. But on the flip side, if you are frugal and learn as much as you can, trading options can be a  nice way to generate money quickly without too much physical work. Options trading really is just for “play” money; again, I advocate putting 99%  of your money into a Roth IRA or 401K.

Now onto the fourteen things I’ve learned trading options. I, myself,  read this list EVERY TIME I’M ABOUT TO PUT IN AN OPTIONS ORDER. I’ve probably canceled a dozen trades after I’ve read my own list just because I’ve let emotions get hold of me and this list brings me back to reality. This is in regards to purchasing puts and calls options on Robinhood - I am not using a margin account and selling options that I myself have created. This list isn’t necessarily in order of importance.

1. Limit your losses (always) – Decide how much your bottom limit is and stick to it. If you let an option expire worthlessly, you're worthless. It’s your money. Always keep enough in the brokerage account to at least place a couple more orders. When you have to add money to your brokerage account from savings to keep trading, you’re losing. Sell your non-performing option at your limit and don't think twice.
2. Don’t buy options for smaller companies, stocks, or ETFs based on hunches or charts. Smaller stocks don’t have the volumes or liquidity and there will be no one around to buy your Out-of-the-Money option if the market is heading the wrong direction.
3. If you win (your option hits its price target),  you’ll probably be up a good amount, so sell when the trend is favorable.  You’ll never know what will happen in the next few hours or days. Some news might hit, the president will tweet about China, or a  scandal could erupt, and everything goes down or vice-versa.
4. You’ll never time the sale of an In-the-money option exactly at the peak price of the day so it’s OK to sell after it’s coming down from the intra-day high. Better to make some money on the drop from the high than to wait for it to get back to the peak.
5. It’s OK to sell for a $5, $10, or $20 profit if you’re In The Money and not feeling it and the trend changes or news hits.
6. The whole reason you’re doing this is to make money whether or not the market is Rising or Falling. Don’t get emotional about what you *want* to happen to the market or company. Only go by the numbers and make money off of the trend.
7. Don’t let an option ride overnight, after-market trading is a good way to lose a lot of money real quick once the market opens. You need your sleep and you (probably) don’t like to wake up early. This is not set in stone  because you could be betting on a piece of big after-hours news or earnings (though highly not recommended.)
8. Sometimes stocks are so beaten up, some more bad news just clears the way for a rally because there isn’t any reason to punish the stock further.
9. Same with good news, a stock could be so bid-up that more good news essentially causes a ceiling and there is no reason for it to go up more because it is already so priced for perfection so it goes down.
10. In a bad market, bulls want red openings and bears want green openings.  In a bad market, bulls will buy low right?  And in a bad market bears will fade a gap (short). 
11. Keep a good positive mindset and just keep hitting singles for $20, $30, $50, whatever, and keep the loser mentality away.
12. It sucks you can only do 3 same-day trades in 5 days (thx lucassommer) but don’t allow that fact make you ride an option longer than its value. Theta (the closer your option is to the expiration date, the less value it will hold) will steal your money anyway so stick to day trades with options.  If you have a long-term bet then buy the actual stock.
13. Implied  Volatility (IV) – when looking to buy an option, look at the Implied Volatility. If it is something high like 91%, then you can probably expect to see the value of your options (most likely) swing/drop 91%  during the term of your option. Options are not the best vehicle during earnings. It’s best to sell and make any profit you can before earnings come out. I YOLO bought $375 worth of SBUX call options on a Thursday with IV of 91% which expired the next day (Friday.) The option made almost no money on Thursday, then favorable earnings came out that Thurs night.  The stock jumped up a little in after-hours trading then went back down again. The next morning it dropped like a rock 91 %. I got out that morning and lost $300. Then later that day, like not even 2 hours later,  the stock went back up to its previous close. I could have just held on through the IV and not lost as much, but it takes real guts to hold in that situation, which you don’t want to go through, believe me. Again, holding options through earnings is very risky unless it’s something like MSFT which beat it’s projected earnings by a lot and IV was low. Place your bet after the earnings and then watch the market reaction. Because example SBUX call option was expiring the same day, theta was going to quickly eat into its value even if I held during the rise after the sharp drop.

The returns have been minor so far, and I don't see that changing in the next 2-3 years.  Wouldn't it be wiser to switch into bonds such as the iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF (up 8.52% YTD return)?  And then get back into the S&P500 after it goes further downhill?  I see the value of buying as a stock is going down, but I just spent from December up until now buying it on the way down and the way back up and I'm starting to feel like I need to switch up my strategy?  My strategy is to buy and hold as this is a longterm investment, but I have the time and energy to be more active if it might increase my returns and help me at least get to 6% for the year....",1,55

Almost every single Pokemon and Magic the Gathering booster box doubles in price after just 2 years.

______

That's not just a recent trend either, that has been the case for over 20 years now. Look up literally any Pokemon card set that's more that 2 years old and see for yourself. Some from even just 3 years ago go for $400 (buy price is $90-ish). I have been following the card game for 10+ years now and time and time again the boxes release at $90ish, drop to $85ish after a couple months, and then a few months later they go up continuously forever.

The main reason for price increase is because once a set of cards come out, they will never come out again. Every box someone opens is one less sealed box in existence... so as you would imagine over time more people are opening them and the price of the remaining sealed ones go up.

___

Is there something I am missing here? It's such a disgustingly low risk for such a disgustingly high reward. People would literally kill to have odds like that in stock markets so it puzzles me why so few take advantage of it. Is taking 2-3 years to basically double your money guaranteed really too low-yield to bother with? That seems above average at the very least to me...

2019-08-18 15:03:13,"A useless data point regarding ""Time in the market vs timing the market""","I think we're in a more uncertain time than we were, say, two years ago, and people might feel (rightfully) queasy about making further investments with markets near all-time highs, with the combination of global and political uncertainty.

Invariably, when they ask, the mantra is ""time in the market beats timing the market"", with the most common argument that if you missed the 10 or 20 best months the market had, you'd pay a steep price.

I hate just taking other peoples word for this, so I download historic data for the S&P 500 to check myself.

**Time in the market:**

if someone invested $10,000 on 1/1/1950 and let it sit, they would end up with $1,164,069 at the end of July 2019. Not bad, right?

**Timing the market (round 1 - the worst market timer):**

Next, we have the worst possible market timer, and they miss 20 of the S&P's best months, but otherwise slogged through it all. Their $10,000 would have grown to a measly $153,876 during that period.

So I guess that's it, right? Time in the market wins? Not so fast.

**Timing the market (round 2 - the best market timer):**

What about the best market timer of them all, who managed to miss the 20 worst months? Their reward from an initial $10,000 investment is a cool $11,682,636. We don't speak about them, though.

**Timing the market (round 3 - the best and worst all in one):**

Finally, we have a middle of the road type, who somehow sold out before the 20 worst months the market had, but they also sold out before the best 20 months as well. Their ending balance is $1,580,457. 

Is this an argument for timing the market? Sell out all your investments and sit in cash waiting for the next recession? No. The problem being, that none of us has the benefit of knowing what the future holds. We can guess at it, but if you follow the posts on /r/investing and nearly any other message board, the investing public goes through violent mood swings between total euphoria and total depression on a near daily basis. 

That said, I do think there are middle grounds, especially for those of us who are still building our retirement nest eggs. 

**Dollar cost averaging**

The first is simply dollar cost averaging. We do this automatically, through our bi-weekly payroll deductions. We're not buying the top or bottom of the market, we're just contributing a like amount at regular intervals, insuring that we're buying when stocks are both expensive and cheap.

When people look at their nest eggs, they see the amount they've invested so far, and seem to disregard what they're putting in. You might be 100% stock in your portfolio, but if you're on track to contribute 25% of the value of your portfolio this year in new contributions, you might as well look at your portfolio as between 66-75% equity and 25-33% cash.

**Asset allocation**

There are many different allocation ideas around here, ranging from Bogle, to Swensen, to Dalio, and probably others that are even more complicated.

The great thing about any of those is, if you're diligent, you're practically guaranteed to be be buying cheaper assets and selling your appreciated assets (which is: buy low, sell high). The only issue is the psychological one, where people might not want to sell their winners in order to buy their losers (""why should I sell treasuries to buy equities when treasuries are doing so well""?). So again, some diligence is needed here. 

I personally HATE treasuries as long term investments, but I hold them as a hedge against uncertainty, so I'm always happy to ""have"" to sell treasuries to buy equities. Conversely, when market changes are forcing the sale of equities to buy treasuries, I kind of applaud myself for getting to sell high. 

**Personal experience**

I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't say what I've actually been doing, I think. So yes, in 1 portfolio, I got to sell treasuries for equities recently.

In the other, which has exposures to everything, I did revert to a 10% cash position. I did maintain my allocation targets, so I sold fewer treasuries than equities comparatively, but while I felt it important to always have some market exposure, I've also decided that I might want to take the following few months to average back in. And, going back to the political, if in December, the tariffs against China rhetoric is heating up, I'll probably do the same thing all over again, raise some cash and then immediately start averaging back in over the next few months.

Is this strategy smart? Time will tell. And in all honesty, probably not. I'm a little ahead of where I would have been so far this month, but maybe even by the end of the months, I'll regret it. Point being, even if you lay out the most perfect of plans, sometimes your own psychology is the biggest enemy of them all.

Anyways, this all started because I keep reading the ""time in the market vs timing the market"" mantra, and wanted to dig a little deeper than ""what if you missed the X best months"" to see if you'd managed to avoid bad months as well as a mixture between the two. Maybe you all will find it interesting, who knows.",0,20

2019-08-31 04:14:14,Why Gold is a terrible store of value,"All of us have heard countless number of comments on how Gold is a great store of value. This post is to debunk it.

Inflation rate started to go above 2% from 1966. Gold was $275 in 1966 (taking lowest point in 1966) and Gold was $1950 in 2011 (taking highest point in 2011). Take note that $275 is close to Gold's ATL (all time low) point and $1950 is Gold's ATH (all time high) point. Therefore we are giving Gold the biggest possible jump in ROI.

Gold did roughly 609% during that span of 45 years or 13.53%/year (the correct value is 4.45% to account for compounded interest. credits to  [SubstantialMonitor0](https://np.reddit.com/user/SubstantialMonitor0/) ). Initially it look like those are great returns however take note that during the last 45 years, there has been massive amount of inflation to the USD.

The 1959 money supply was 138,900 million and 2019 was 3,852,100 million. The money supply  has gone up 27.7 times or 2670% in the span of 60 years. The earlier calculation for Gold was a span of only 45 years and it only did 609% with consideration it was mostly between Gold's ATL and ATH. For Gold to retain the same value, it should have gone up 2670% or so and this is just to retain its value, not increase in value.

Do you still think Gold is a great store of value? Do you think the price of eggs and bread in 1966 was just 7 times the current price? I think in the last 20 years alone, food has already gone up 5-7 times.

Update 1: Due to sizable confusion, let me give an example. Let say I was in the 1960s and I have 10k usd to my name. With 10k usd, and eggs, milk, bread, all priced at like nothing, 10k usd will have bought me a ton of everything and I am probably rich at that time. Now let say I put all of that into Gold as a ""great store of value,"" decades into the future, my 10k can buy less of everything now since everything is priced with inflation. If USD has gone up 27 times in 60 years, I think eggs will have gone up 27 times at least in the same amount of time. All our necessities will increase in price to reflect inflation. Do you think eggs were just 7 times cheaper in 1960s? Food has already gone up 5-7 times in the last 20 years. That said, however holding Gold is still better than holding USD but I think land/property may be a better hold of value or even eggs if they can last that long.

Update 2: It has been corrected that Gold is a good store of value in the US vs price of milk because milk only went about 6x since the 1960s, from $0.49 per gallon to today around $3.10 per gallon (pointed out by  [gotNoGSD](https://np.reddit.com/user/gotNoGSD/) and [\_Black\_Mirror\_IRL\_](https://np.reddit.com/user/_Black_Mirror_IRL_/)). However because I am not an American, food has gone up drastically in the last 20 years for me and it can be close to 7-10x. It is common for my parents to say that they will spend $0.10 for a meal in their childhood, while today the average meal will cost $15-20. This is in Asia. I am starting to think that a chicken farm in Asia is a good store of value lol.

2019-09-01 22:53:46,[TA] S&P 500 is showing a technically clean set-up for a major shorting opportunity at 3150 around Oct 31 hard Brexit,"[Link to charts.](https://imgur.com/a/OEyELt1)

Technical analysis & commentary:

The S&P 500 is setting up perfectly for a crash around Oct 31 when the U.K. hard Brexits. The chart shows a clean technical trend towards an inflection point on that day—a strange coincidence. Here is some (hopefully) simple (enough) analysis to help you understand the risk of this particular scenario.

Looking at the chart with a daily timeframe (Chart #1), the medium term trend for the market is making a megaphone pattern (dark green lines). It looks like this < on the chart but is pointing to 9:30 p.m. on the chart instead of 9 p.m. This is a bearish trend that shows limited upside (top dark green line is flattish) with increasing volatility (cone of the megaphone is expanding) to the downside (bottom dark green line is steeper than top line).

The short term trend is making a flag pattern (light green lines). It looks like this > on the chart but is pointing to 2 p.m. on the chart instead of 3 p.m. This is a bullish trend showing a series of higher highs and lower lows.

The price has traded very neatly within these trends in the last few weeks. The trends collide on Oct 4, at which point the price will break-out of one trend and confirm the other. As we count down to Brexit, I think the market will trade throughout Oct between 3000-3150, above the dark green top line and into the end of the light green flag pattern. But it will be a bull-trap. The reality of hard Brexit may be the catalyst that confirms the megaphone pattern.

This prediction is supported by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator (Chart #1; second graph with intertwined blue and orange lines). MACD on the daily timeframe is beneath zero, indicating downward momentum, but that momentum is becoming less negative (shown by the cyclical uptick towards zero).

The Relative Strength Index (third graph with purple line) is currently at 68 on the daily timeframe, short of the 80 mark which usually triggers selling. Both of these indicators suggest the market has one last little heave to give towards the 3150 level before it stalls and crashes.

Looking at the chart with the monthly timeframe (Chart #2), we see the correlation between the unemployment rate (orange line) and recessions. Weakening employment conditions are the final indicator before a crash as it shows recessionary effects have passed from manufacturing through the whole economy to workers and consumers. Historically, a 0.3%+ increase in the three month moving average (MA) of the unemployment rate (not shown in charts) has signalled a recession is imminent. The jobs number is reported the first Friday of every month. The unemployment 3m MA has ticked up in the last couple months and will likely reach 3.9%, the critical level (3.6% low plus 0.3%)...in Oct. The RSI and MACD on the monthly chart also look prime to turn negative. So the stars are aligning for Oct 31.

If the market crashes, there are no established technical price levels where we can expect support (shown by horizontal red lines on Chart #1; support is when there is more buying than selling, which drives the price up) until 2350, a level last reached in the Dec 2018 tremor that shook global markets. Interestingly, the megaphone pattern indicates the next low will be 2100 around Jan 14 - Feb 14 2020; 2100 is the next technical price level with support. Below 2100 the next major support is 1800, which would represent a 40% decline from 3150, but losses could run deeper.

If this set up comes about, it represents a huge trading opportunity. I'd recommend at the money puts on the SPY with 20-40 day expiry. A safe entry price will be when the price crosses the 200 day moving average (blue line on Chart #1, first graph). By safe I mean relatively safe; trading options on a leveraged index is for professionals and requires proper due diligence.",0,27

I have a unique investment strategy that I do for myself, but others have expressed an interest in participating. I think it is very marketable to a niche market and I’m considering creating my own fund. It is an alternative strategy that is easy to communicate and I believe almost sells itself to certain investor types. I have a job I like so this would just be a side thing. I wouldn’t make much money in fees from this to start, but I’m already doing the work for my PA with my strategy and I like the entrepreneurial aspect of this.

I’d probably just have around $50k-$75k to manage to start which won’t make much in fees. My investment strategy is scaleable so more AUM isn’t going to be much more work beyond administration. I have marketing ideas.

I am considering starting a partnership through LegalZoom but I am really not familiar with how to properly set something up. I would be very interested if anyone has any experience and/or advice they can share in terms of properly setting up an investment fund. Thank you.",0,18

2019-10-27 07:10:34,A merger of Oracle and Amazon would give AWS clients the security of Oracle's Gen 2 infrastructure and access to their huge database business," “The design goal of Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is one secure platform to run everything,"" Larry Ellison told the OpenWorld conference on Monday morning. ""It’s easy to say, very hard to do, to build a secure cloud.""  

Oracle has struggled to grow its cloud business.

The low hanging workloads that could be easily migrated to the cloud have largely already migrated and driven growth at AWS. But the remaining workloads are mostly mission critical and have high security requirements. 

That makes a possible merger an attractive scenario for both parties.   

The one problem is such a large merger would attract a lot of scrutiny from regulators.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research.

2019-11-17 22:54:59,Potentially found the next bubble. Leveraging debt to purchase companies for inflated prices for the purpose of increasing ROI.,"This doesn't seem to be a new idea, in fact it seems to be an old idea since there was a book written by someone called Josh Kosman in 2009 called ""The Buyout of America: How Private Equity Will Cause the Next Great Credit Crisis"".

But lately there are so many things that is abusing this to a large extent, or making a bit obvious. Companies like Sears, Toys R Us, WeWork, and countless smaller companies like a [$300 MILLION investment in a dog walking app](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/26/680260426/dog-walking-app-attracts-300-million-investment-from-saudi-arabia). Basically taking forcing large amounts of debt on these companies to practically bankrupt them. Causing many people to become unemployed.

With Soft Bank's current investments and Saudia Arabia seem to be upping the action in it too, with what I suspect is the reasoning they are trying to raise 25 billion through their Aramco IPO. I somewhat fear ""what would happen if too many of these smaller companies decide to lay off or go bankrupt at the same time"".

I just learned about all this with a small discussion with /u/evilcounsel in /r/Economics and he also seemed to be looking into this previously and learned about Collateralized loan obligations which is apparently packaging company debt and selling that debt much like the mortgage crisis of the 2008.

So here we are many large private equity firms are abusing debt to purchase companies for absurd amounts, repackaging the debt as CLO's all for the purpose of increasing their profits. Seems like a scary thought to me.

Net income soared by 86% to $621 million or $1.50 per share. The latest quarter included an unrealized gain of $249 million on an investment in Pivotal Software. Adjusted earnings decreased by 4% to $1.49 per share.

Revenue grew by 12% to $2.46 billion. License revenue increased by 10% to $974 million. The results reflected broad-based strength across its product and solutions portfolio.

Hybrid Cloud Subscription and SaaS revenue grew to over 13% of total revenue in Q3, and the company expects this category to continue to grow significantly next year, including the contributions of Carbon Black and Pivotal.

For the third quarter, the company continued to see traction and customer momentum in support of VMware’s vision to deliver a software architecture that enables any app, on any cloud, delivered to any device. The company remained on track to close the acquisition of Pivotal Software by the end of the fiscal year.

For the quarter, software maintenance services revenue increased by 12.5% year-over-year to $1.28 billion. Professional services revenue grew by 13.5% to $202 million. Services accounted for 60% of the total revenue while license accounted for just 40%.

2019-12-19 11:25:59,Stock market is manipulated using ESP.,"ESP, clairvoyance, whatever, the CIA has released documents that state that ESP can be trained to some degree using a machine.

The machine : 4 buttons, 4 states, randomly generated, you'd expect the probability to be 1/4

After hundreds of trails, participants can skew their probablity greatly, to the point where they are either very right, or very wrong.. i.e. 24/30 right, or 2/30 right... these are both ESP

So now you just do that with stonks, you train the populace unwittingly via media, and all you have to do is identify which way it will go, are they all going to be wrong, all they all going to be right.

Calls and puts are a 50/50 probability affair, yet most people who play options report 99% failure. When they buy calls, it drops, when they buy puts, it spikes.

So the SPY for the last week has been at 320, and not budged a bit, flat-lined. Another 50/50, will it go up, will it go down, pay attention to how you are conditioned.

2019-12-21 12:31:30,Confessions of an amateur market timer,"I've seen a lot of posts on here lately about market timing. Typically the OP says they are timing the market because \[insert impending doom\] and then everyone else yells at OP and the phrase ""time in the market..."" gets repeated a thousand times. To me, it's all getting a bit stale. And yet here I am still timing the market. So I thought I'd do some soul searching and post what I've found in case it helps move the conversation along. This isn't supposed to be an argument for market timing. It's just a description of my mindset. 

**I was young enough to get burned by the great recession but not old enough to take advantage of it.** I graduated college in 2007 and moved to a big city for an entry level job. Then the great recession hit. I didn't get laid off but I sure didn't get any raises or bonuses either. I also didn't invest enough. I didn't have a high enough salary to come anywhere close to maxing out my retirement funds, and I didn't have the motivation to either. I had just watched my parents' retirement funds get cut in half during the financial crisis, and I wasn't in a hurry to do the same thing. I also wanted to save up for a better apartment, grad school, etc. I didn't understand that I was coasting through the best investing opportunity in a generation until it was too late. 

**The stock market doesn't seem to reflect reality... at least not my reality.** The world seems to be so full of risks, and yet the stock market doesn't care. Trade partnerships are falling apart, corporate debt is mounting, business investment is declining. And yet the stock market keeps moving higher. I don't get it. Then again, I'm a liberal, so my assessment of the global financial environment is colored in party by my dissatisfaction with current political trends. 

**I** ***want*** **the market to crash.** This is the most important motivation, I think. I want another chance to grab stocks on a bargain. If the market is going to crash, I want it to just happen now. I don't want to keep investing at inflated stock prices. I'm young and still have plenty of time to invest before retirement. Let's rip the band aid off and get on with the stock correction already! But if I'm going to take advantage of a market crash, I have to build up some dry powder instead of investing all my spare income in retirement. I have to time the market if I'm going to take advantage of a market crash. 

**I'm a victim of the sunk cost fallacy.** For the past two years, I've been steering my retirement contributions into a money market fund so that I can rebalance into stocks later after the stock crash that never came. Now the market has moved higher and stocks are even more expensive. My feeling about stocks haven't changed at all, though, so why would I jump back in now?

**TLDR:** I've got lots of conflicting reasons why I'm trying to time the market. None of them quite make sense, but they make just enough sense that they're hard to shake.",3,15

2019-12-28 15:04:08,Have we had our last recession ever?,"We've had a long run of phenomenal growth... Longer and better than any previous expansion in history. Maybe that's because we've been lucky and just haven't run into anything in a while that was enough to cause a downturn, or maybe there is an underlying strong reason for the continued growth...

The only thing that can drive per-capita economic activity in an upward trend is improvement in productivity. There have been periods where other factors temporarily depressed productivity, but eventually technological advancement wins out and drives productivity further up. The faster tech improves, the bigger shock will be needed to halt growth.

Technology can advance because more people are working to advance it. As economies around the world grow, a higher percentage of people get education, and the more people are capable of contributing to technological advancement. Also, the higher the population, the more people there are who can contribute to advancement.

Finally, the biggest factor may be AI. It's come a long way in the last 10 years and it will never regress. It will only ever get better. Right now this means human creativity is augmented to an ever increasing degree. Eventually, it will be smarter than we are and human genius will no longer be the driving force of technological advancement. Someone coined a term for this... It's called the technological spike.

When the spike happens, it will probably be the companies that own the tech that benefit the most. Those companies will probably be the biggest companies with the biggest R&D budgets. If we're already close enough to the spike that the upward trend dominates external downward pressures, then we've passed a run-away tipping point and the economy may no longer be capable of contraction.

So what do you think? Should I max out my margin in anticipation of ever accelerating growth?",0,29

A few things scream out to me immediately:  


I. They had no capital in their business. The story was that they had no profits (I question that now) but they had no capital in their business for a long time. Invested capital was negative for a long time until 2012 when they got into the cloud systems they're known for (and AWS is the massive cash flow machine it is). Chanos pointed this out in a fireside chat he had with Dan Gilbert (which ultimately created my interest in looking into the statements now). ""The money followed the investment"". 

&#x200B;

II. They only had two years where they were shrinking more than they were growing (I see this as Capex<D&A) and those two years were 2007 and 2009. They shrank by a very small amount. No business grows continually forever so this comes as no surprise. 

&#x200B;

III. For the years chosen here they were free cash flow positive, net revenue positive, and EBITDA positive. They had negative net income in 2014. An amazing run. Consistent gross margins also with very little fluctuation. They had negative book value in 2004. Their return on net tangible equity also was fantastic with one negative year in 2004.",0,97

2020-01-05 21:48:45,10 Dividend Stocks Every 20 Something Should Invest In.,"All the listed dividend growth stocks have paid and raised their dividend annually for at least 10 years. They are established companies with businesses that have been through terrible market turmoil and have come out stronger.

These stocks can be the foundation of a great dividend portfolio that will get investors through decades of consistent and focused investing that will return capital appreciation and dividend growth.

Investors would be diversified in 5 sectors of the economy. They would be invested in companies that take their dividend payouts seriously and would likely continue to pay and raise their dividends far into the future.

1) **Johnson & Johnson** is a healthcare company that was founded in 1885. It was been paying and raising its dividend annually for over 54 years. In a stock market with thousands of stocks, there are only a handful that have a longer streak.

2) **3M** is one of the most diversified healthcare, technology, and industrial companies in the world founded in 1902. It has been paying and raising its dividend for 59 years.

3) **Coca-Cola** was founded in 1886 and sells and distributes non-alcoholic drinks around the world. Dividend streak – 55 years.

4) **Procter & Gamble** was founded in 1837 and sells beauty, grooming, cleaning, and child care products around the world. Dividend streak – 61 years.

5) **McDonald’s** was founded in 1940 and has over 35,000 restaurants around the world. Dividend streak – 42 years.

6) **Medtronics** was founded in 1949 and is in the healthcare sector. The company sells medical devices and has a dividend streak of 29 years.

7) **Pepsico** was founded in 1898 and sells drinks, food, and snacks around the world. Dividend streak – 29 years.

8) **Qualcomm** was founded in 1985 and designs, develops, manufactures, and markets digital communication products worldwide. Dividend streak – 13 years.

9) **Southern Company** was founded in 1945 engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Dividend streak – 17 years.

10) **Microsoft** was founded in 1975 and develops, licenses, and supports software, services, devices, and solutions worldwide. Dividend streak 15 years

I'm working my way into owning all ten of these companies. I am in my late 40’s. I plan to have all of them in my portfolio over the next 3-5 years. I hold 13 companies right now and have 25%ish of my portfolio in an S&P 500 fund. I hold 10-15% in cash to add to my current shares or buy new positions when I believe valuations are right. 

I want to have a dividend portfolio of approximately 25 stocks by the time I hit 55 years of age.

2020-01-08 00:46:43,Why the Iran panic is just a great buying opportunity.,"A conflict with Iran cannot seriously hurt the American or global economy. The selloffs we're seeing right now are panic reactions, driven by investors' ignorance of Iran's actual capabilities and geopolitical status, as well as far too much credence to Iranian propaganda aimed to misrepresent themselves as a regional power that can unleash hell.

Iran does not have the capability to significantly disrupt the global oil supply. Not even by the classic ""attacking tankers in the Straits of Hormuz"" tactic.

Their navy is very old, poorly maintained, technologically backwards, and simply no match to modern navies like the US or UK. Half their navy was casually sunk by the US in Operation Praying Mantis, and since then they had no strategy or build up of large-vessel navy power. They've been making plenty of threats, because they want to be seen as a strong, menacing regional superpower that should not be pushed around, but the only navy action they took recently was taking over a civilian tanker which was left defenseless, using commando tactics and small boats - practically, all their navy has and is right now. They tried the same tactics in the presence of a single British warship, and it drove their small, weak, poorly-armed boats away immediately.

In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition.

Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were?  F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all.

The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers.

Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking.

Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation. The Russians would enter such a conflict only to defend one nation and that is Russia. The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies.

All of Iran's other allies are sub-state actors that are typically classified as terror groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraq, and Houthi rebel groups in Yemen. These are very large, well-funded, well-trained, and well-armed - as far as such groups go. They are proficient in guerilla and terror operations under asymmetric conditions. However, they are not military forces, and will not be able to accomplish any of the strategic goals that Iran itself can't achieve, such as disrupting oil shipment or meaningfully harming global trade or economy in any other way. Of course, the idea that they can effectively fight back against the US, NATO, or any modern European nation is a complete joke; quite simply, they have no navy nor airforce. The only way they can get to the US is by buying an airline ticket. They could launch some terror attacks but that's it.

TL;DR Iran greatly exaggerates its own capabilities and threats because it's in a tough position, while its actual options are limited. It cannot meaningfully disrupt global oil supply, or any other aspect of global trade or economy. Recent spikes in oil and dips in market indices were caused by typical panicking investors who lend these threads too much credit because they're not aware of the real status of Iranian military capabilities and Iran's true geopolitical standing.",19,65
2020-01-10 10:12:40,If I just keep working X more years and keep putting X money into my 401K I will have X more money in retirement!,"It is very hard to stop working and stop participating in the company 401K.

2020-01-13 13:27:05,Why Tesla has become a must-own stock,"With clear competitive advantages in powertrain design, battery, ADAS fleet size, and a brand that consumers get excited about, TSLA should be a must-own stock for the next several years. As the renewables and autonomy trends accelerate, Tesla should not only gain shares, but also realize significant operating leverage. It has reached sufficient scale to achieve sustainable FCF, although the company's higher risk tolerance may also mean the stock will continue to trade with higher volatility. A few additional data points on why Tesla has become a must-own for the next few years.

1) Analysts believe Tesla is tracking about 3 years ahead of competition in their powertrain technology.

2) With 600k+ vehicles on the road collecting data, Tesla has a significant advantage in evolving their Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS).

3) Tesla's above-average risk tolerance has also resulted in accelerated learning cycles, as reflected in their fast ramp up in China.

4) With Model 3/Y platform development complete, capacity expansion across China and Germany should drive operating leverage and upside to margin over next 36 months (but China may be a drag on near term margins).

5) Demand for stock could increase from inclusion in additional indexes.",27,137

But 2% is a *short term anomaly*.  Historically, the Fed had to cut 5% to get us out of a recession.  5% fed fund rate is *a healthy economy and full normalization*.

Therefore, using a 5% fed fund rate for DCF, stocks are very overvalued.

BUYING at these prices is mainly chasing the repo liquidity, which is fine, but the long term, it seems like a dangerous play because its based on liquidity and not fundamentals.

THE other corollary is that well be at 2% or lower for longer implying stock prices are elevated and not in a bubble. BUT if you hold that view you must also accept we are in a liquidity trap.  IMPLYING that if the Fed ever reduces the balance sheet the financial markets will collapse.",4,37

In China, they've locked down major cites.  Hundreds of millions of people are under quarantine.  Entire apartment blocks are being welded shut with people still inside. Borders have been closed.  Flights cancelled. Factories closed.  And their health care system is overwhelmed.  And yet here in the states the spin doctors are hard at work trying to convince everyone that the seasonal flu ""kills more people"" and that the virus seems to have been ""contained.""  And yet the virus is now popping up all over the world.  Thousands of people fly into the USA every day, some of whom may be spreading the disease without knowing they're infected and without exhibiting any symptoms.  So unless Americans have some magical immunity, it could be just a matter of time before what's happening in China will be happening here.  

Aside from the medical issues, our country is very much reliant on goods manufactured in China, including drugs and health care supplies.  That's not good.

2020-02-15 10:49:40,Tesla semi truck feasibility analysis,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I've been invested in Tesla for a while and would like to know that you guys think. Since there's sentiment that the bull case for Tesla assumes the success of the semi (which could be potentially huge), I'd like to share some analysis.

On Tesla's website, the semi is listed with a range of 500 mi range at <2kWh per mile at $180k. That means the battery pack has, at max, 1000 kWh of energy.

With a back of the envelope calculation assuming 70 mph, level road driving, drag coeff. of .36 (which is best case scenario), .0045 rolling coeff. (also best case scenario), 80,000 lb total load, at sea level (air density = 1.225 kg/m\^3):

* Aero force = Q\*Cd\*S = .5\*1.225\*(31.2928 m/s)\^2\*.36\*10 m\^2 = 2,159 Newtons
* Rolling resistance force = N\*Crr = 36287.39 kg\*9.81 m/s\^2\*.0045 = 1,602 Newtons

The semi must overcome those combined forces to do work, and the energy equation here is E=F\*d.

* Energy required = (Aero force + Rolling resist. force)\*dist. = 3,761 Newtons \* 804672 m = 3.027 \*10\^9 Joules = **841 kWh**

It seems, at the very minimum, the battery back needs to be 841 kWh **based on physics**. That is assuming level ground, no acceleration or deceleration, normal temperature, best case aerodynamics, best case rolling resistance.

I feel like a 159 kWh buffer to account for temperature variations, going up hill, etc. isn't enough. What if the trailer isn't the type that is completely flush with the truck (like the ones that transport cars). This will drastically affect aero. What if there are rear view mirrors? These do not cause insignificant drag. What if the tires aren't maintained well? Etc. There are many off nominal cases to account for.

I'm not entirely sure they can pull off a 500 mi range based on these assumptions. Thoughts? Criticisms?

So I have the following in mind.

1. 33% - golden butterfly allocation 
2. 33% - dividend growth investing 
3. 33% - high savings account (wealthfront)

Let me know if this would protect me from the downside while giving me a decent amount of returns. 


EDIT 02/20 

Here is a summary of all the nuggets that came out from this thread. Love it. Will updated when I plan my portfolio.

-VGRO for the win. ( probably VUG)

-three-fund portfolio
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)
Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX)
Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBTLX)

-I personally like some international exposure so have 20% of my portfolio in VTIAX.
Great article in international investing https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/international-investing-myths

-SPCE. Bet it all on $40 June calls.

-You might consider a r/bogleheads portfolio.
Here is my set it and forget it allocation:
70% VTSAX (ETF equivalent is VTI)
20% VTIAX (ETF equivalent is VXUS)
10% VBTLX (ETF equivalent is BND)

-A very general rule of thumb is that your bond allocation should equal your age minus 10 (i.e., a 40-year old investor would own approximately 30% bonds, 70% stocks).

-I plan to dollar cost average into simple investments like the S&P, dividend growth fund DGRO (which I just love), and some bonds for safety.
It’s very similar to VIG

-Everything into SPCE calls. Literally no risk ( are you serious?)

-if you want to mess with things, i would say swap the small cap value for dividend growth in the golden butterfly. ( Makes sense)
having 33% of your 750k in high savings is DUMB. (thanks)

-Dollar cost average into the market. Select an appropriate asset allocation for your goals. ( Yes!!!)

-Be aware that the average return (say 6-7%) is not the same as as what you can realistically draw as an income.First, for a consistent income stream you need to inflation proof the principle.

-Also the portfolios that have been analyzed to death that can reliably support that are basically 50 to 70 percent broadly diverse equities and the difference in broadly diverse bonds (index funds with essentially no fees or loads of course).
6-12mo DTE AAPL/MSFT CALLS. LEHGO (Nah!)

-I would invest a small PORTION, into a mix of dividend stocks/etf, a mix of growth stocks/etf, and a mix of gold and gold miners. I wouldn’t do bonds personally, but I would consider high yield saving account if it is liquid and they payout interest often (daily) and I can transfer money quickly to take advantage of market opportunities. ( Dividend stocks and Growth stocks makes sense)

-I wouldn’t put everything in the market all at once. Start very small and add to your positions slowly until you get more comfortable and understand the market more. Always have some cash on the sideline to take advantage of potential opportunities. ( Will follow this advice)

-If it were my 700k I would invest in Dividend Kings and Aristocrats and let the yield on cost grow over the next decade or two. ( Thanks for letting me know, i will look into it more)

-My recommendation would be to DCA into a growth fund like VUG over the next 12-24 months. That will protect you from a sudden correction. Personally, I wouldn't invest in dividend/value tickers, especially if you're under 40. (I’d definitely do this, Thanks. I will do Dividend growth for the passive income)

-If I suddenly got $700K, I'd put it all in high-growth tech funds. (If this was 2015 and I were to d it again, I’d do it. FAANGU stocks might be at peak)
However, there's still value to be found in this expensive market. For example, the banking sector still looks undervalued relative to the S&P. So you can probably divide your allocation between growth, value, and money market funds.

-bitcoin (Will run away from any crypto)

-Everything else which isn't that defensive cushion is a highly diversified portfolio of stocks which produce an average dividend of 1.7%. Having more cash or bonds than you need is typically going to underperform.
VGRO for the win. Set it and forget it! (Probably not, I’d probably do a US growth fund)

-If you were to try to diy look up some ways to invest in non correlated asset classes that offer a higher rate of return while limiting down side.
If you want dividends, I'm a fan on the high yield bond fund. Make sure you do your research as to what's actually in it, though, and balance your portfolio accordingly. Understand the risks involved in bonds, and the risks involved in bonds that pay 8%, before investing. ( I think VWINX is a good one)

-I'll throw out the two rock solid fundsI always recommend: Vwelx/vwinx. The divvy alone will at least keep your assets in the game, and if you look at '08 vwinx only took a 27% hit from previous highs. ( I like the VWINX more)

-Simply put your money into VTWAX. total world stock index. Maximum diversification. Low cost. Low risk as possible. (not too optimistic about the emerging market and frontier markets)

2020-02-16 11:21:41,"PSA: A month into the 2008 Great Recession, I told my dad to sell his shares. He didn’t sell. And I was WRONG.","Time in the market beats market timing.

You cannot predict recessions.  In hindsight it’s easy to look back at a chart of the 08 recession and think you should have sold when the market dropped 10% at the top and bought back in when the market increased 10% from the bottom.  But you have to factor in human psychology.  

(A) Who knows if the 10% or 20% drop is the start of a major recession or just a temporary correction?  If it’s part of a correction that happens regularly, you’ve just sold at the lowest point and you wouldn’t realize you sold too low until the market has left you behind. Ok, then you say you will only sell after a 30% drop.  How do you know that 30% isn’t the bottom?

(B) When the market starts to go back up 10%, how do you know it’s part of a recovery?  After all, you’ve been living in a recession with all the accompanying job losses and depression around you.  You’ve seen the stock market bounce back temporarily so many times before and you’ve been burned before trying to get back into the market.  By the time you realize you are in a recovery, you saw the price rise 25%.  Psychologically you want to wait until the price drops a little before you buy at the cheaper price you saw just a week ago.  And with so many people still unemployed, this 25% market bump can’t last!  What if the price never goes back down?  Now you’ve lost out on the recovery like so many other people who panic sold during the 08 recession and never got back in (look up the many stories out there).  Meanwhile, those long term buy and hold investors who stayed in the market despite the red ink in their accounts have way bigger nest eggs than before the crisis.

TL;DL:  it’s easy in hindsight to look at a stock chart of a recession and find the entry and exit points.  Most that try to time the market don’t actually know what they will do in the midst of a recession and will be left out of the recovery.",4,19

2020-02-23 09:50:50,Stock Buybacks,"I don’t agree with Bernie on much, but I do think banning stock buybacks (or at least limiting them) has some validity.

At face value, it’s ridiculous to say that a company can’t but its own stock. Companies would probably just declare larger dividends or sit on giant stock piles of cash. Some, however, may invest in new projects, which could lead to more innovation and job creation. Earnings would better reflect how a company is at evaluating emerging opportunities. Maybe workers could be paid more.

This could be overreaching by the government, and would actively limit the creation of shareholder value, but it would be a sacrifice for the greater good that encouraged competition. Just banning buybacks isn’t the answer, but I think it’s along those lines.

52% of earnings were spent on buybacks for 465/500 of S&P 500 companies between 2009 and 2018.

2020-02-24 21:15:49,"In 2020, ignoring Bitcoin would be irresponsible","This is a post for all the people who ignored Bitcoin until now. I'm not here to say pour all your money into Bitcoin (side note: I will **only** be talking about Bitcoin in this post), but just want to give you some insights on how Bitcoin could dramatically improve your investing portfolio.

Quick history: Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the last decade (a whopping 8,900,000% up since first listed on an exchange). It is also currently \~50% down from its last ATH in Dec 2017. Bitcoin is very volatile, and considered riskier than other investments because it's only 11 years old and lack regulations.

Over the last 5 years, with a global portfolio of 60/40 stocks/bonds that returns 7.2%, if you take half a percent from stocks and half a percent from bonds and put it into Bitcoin, you would have gone to 9.2%. If Bitcoin would have gone to zero you would have a 7% return. It's a 10 to 1 downside.

Bitcoin is an asymmetrical, uncorrelated asset that acts as an hedge against uncertainty and inflation (just like gold, actually many consider it as digital gold).

Bitcoin is also the hardest asset on Earth. In May 2020 its stock-to-flow (how much is created per year vs how much supply currently exists) rate is gonna be about the same as gold. Except that no one can create it faster (whereas if there's a gold rush miners can dig up quicker), it can be transported anywhere in the world in 10 min for a fraction of a dollar, is more private, is decentralized, can't be counterfeit and can't be seized. It's the most scarce asset the world has ever seen, there will only be 21 millions of them, no one will be able to ""print"" more. And Bitcoin is powered by the most powerful network of computers in the world, and is only getting stronger and stronger every day.

Do not put all your savings in Bitcoin. But do some research about it, adding even 1% to your portfolio could yield incredible results. I'm open to any debate or discussion.

None of them have traded through a market with this much leverage, at the end of a business cycle, and a pandemic all at the same time. Many some, but never all three.

With that, we are about to enter the mother of all bear markets, all of the major economies are about to enter a huge recession coupled with possible quarantines. We will see deflation globally and inflation on consumer products domestically. 

So what is the trade now? What are the risks? and who do we do? Honestly wish I had a crystal ball, but this is what I see.

TRADE Now:
Short/buy puts
1. Anything related to travel, hotels, automotive, farm equipment, oil, large industrial ex utilities. (No one is going to be buying any of this) Some of the large industrial and airlines will get bailed out as ""strategic."" The rest won't. 
2. Banks, fin tech, insurance, and retail. These will be hurting, fintech and retail will see the most carnage as they won't be bailed out. Big banks and insurance will get bailed out, and most likely have a ban on shorting them soon.
3. Foreign currency. (USD will be king here on out The only thing that may outperform is swiss francs, but it a much smaller market) (Gold will be attacked from every side as people try and stop it, gold will catch a bid later and will see a huge bull run, but no need to start early.)
4. EMs are doomed, they will be short USD for trade and no tourism. They may catch the first bid on the other side of this recession, but they will see lots of red first.

THE RISK
Bailouts, central banks will bail out all of the usual suspects. This will make them zombies for a while. They will also buy up indexes like the DOW 30, S&P500, Russel 2000. (So careful after they go full blown 30%+ in the red, start to cover and shrink your option positions)
Sovereign debt crisis, after bailing out everything, a lot of M1 money will be created, this will create issues for USD strength later. Duration Tbills will get butchered later. TIPS will be the safer haven, but I doubt they will keep up.

THE PLAY
1. The game is during illiquid period. Go after hotels, cruises, canadian oil, US oil, fintech, EMs, industrials, insurance, and banks. (Many will go insolvent) 
2. when illiquidity ends. Insolvency starts, this is when you get away from the USD. Go long gold, EMs, commodities, foreign currencies and short duration US bonds. 
3. Last, when the US jobs start to recover pile back in on all of the usual suspects: FAANGs, semis, tech everything, banks (maybe)",0,32

- US futures down 4.5%

- US 10 year sinks below 0.5% for the first time ever, market pricing in 1/5 chance of 3/18 rate cut to 0-25 bps

Wow, everything is starting to get really scary. The only thing I can think of is: buy the Canadian dollar and oil stocks when oil goes down to <$25 a barrel.

It is possible that we may limit down 7% on all of the US stock indices shortly after 9:30 AM open tomorrow, creating the 21^st century's own Black Monday (worse than August 24, 2015 or February 5, 2018).

Yes, be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy. But, stocks are still way too high for people with lots of cash on the sidelines. We really need something like 15X P/E for markets to be considered ""Buy"". Also, if US 30 year bond yields hit 0%, it may be time to short bonds because the Federal Reserve does not like negative rates.

EDIT: I will probably buy Canadian dollars tomorrow. Oil has dropped too far, too fast. It lost like 40% of its value in 1 day. There is no way the Canadian dollar will go much lower now.

I argue that this should be extended to entire stock markets.

I can give you the example of Japan: in the 1980s, the Nikkei 225 went to 38900 points and it never recovered. It is 50% below the peak right now. That country is full of elderly people and refuse to accept immigrants, but it is incredibly rich.

I can also give you the example of China, where the index peaked at 6000 points in October 2007 and never recovered (it recovered to 5000 points or so in June 2015 but crashed and is now sitting at 3000 points, down 50% from the 2007 peak). That country had a very high growth rate, but it too refuses to accept immigration and have an incredibly low birth rate and the people there live in poverty.

The Canadian Preferred Shares Index peaked in April of 2007 at 988 points. It crashed to 635 points in the financial crisis and recovered to and stablized at 860 points. It is now at 532 points, lower than it was when the 2008 financial crisis came. It never reclaimed 988 points ever again after 2007, and I expect that it never will. Nevertheless, it will be worth investing into once it declines to 400 points or so.

2020-03-18 09:36:25,"Recession? Let's hope so! If not, we may enter into a depression.","The risk of us entering into a global depression is becoming more real by the day.  Already some of the more straight talking politicians and people of influence are beginning to publicly acknowledge this downturn will be worse than 2008.

A global deflationary depression. Something we've not seen for 100 years (and, coincidentally, has a historically pattern of appearing about every 100 years). During this time owning the stock market in broad ways (index funds) will be one of the worst performing assets.  We might see metals dropping, providing no hedge to those who've used them for that purpose.

Those of us who own properties should already be bracing for possible mark downs in our properties values and certainly be alert to the risk that continuity of rents is not assured at  least  for the immediate future.  It's being openly and prominently called for in political meetings for there to be forbearing rather than foreclosing. On a human level I agree with this,  but from an asset allocation/investors perspective this is obviously not an ideal situation.

&#x200B;

The world economic markets have been staggered lately, but there could be far worse in store.  We may be about to take a beating. A series of right hooks, and this was only the left jab.  The solution usually used at this point is to drop the interest rates and this eases different pressures and flows money into circulation/assets.  Globally central banks have now dropped. Some already all the way at zero (US Fed, for example).  Was the market assuaged? No. Prices went up very briefly and then down  into new lows.

&#x200B;

Well currently sit on the verge of an almost certain recession. At least a couple quarters of negative growth from what we have right in front of us today, but things are getting worse by the hour - literally! In some months  time we're going to be in far worse circumstances. Chances of recession are incredibly high and when we are unable to get out of recessions by stimulating growth we fall  into depression.  A depression is what comes when you can not kick start out of a recession.

&#x200B;

The best medical  systems in the  world are in danger of becoming  overwhelmed in the not too distant future.  What we've seen in China and Italy can  easily spread throughout all countries.  It could well be worse in many other countries. Italy has one of the best  medical systems in  Europe. China's efforts of quarantine and building of new hospitals is something other places will not match.

&#x200B;

Once it becomes apparent that the medical systems are going to become overrun, far harder  restrictions will be put in place.   The only people allowed out will be those who are working to maintain an essential service. This will come down to emergency staff, grocery staff and pharmaceuticals. That's it! Everything else will be considered non-essential and not permitted.

&#x200B;

This is going to lead to many businesses having to close down, and  it will be harder for them to open back up.  Currently massive bail out plans are being announced but these are only enough to keep businesses afloat for a short period of time, if this drags on months or even a year or more (as experts now expect)  there is going to be serious hits to economy.

&#x200B;

The economy is a series of people earning and spending.  Incomes will drop off sharply as people do not get their full time earnings and of course spending will decrease since people have less income. As well as this usual problem in a recession, we also have to contend with the fact there are not a whole lot of places to spend income if things continue to get worse.

&#x200B;

To support the people in the manner they are proposing to, the governments are going to have to rack up outrageous new debt on their balance sheets.  While they are doing this,  there is also various drops in government income as taxes etc need  to be reduced (or just stop due to businesses not trading). Expansions of government debts will later bring more deflationary pressures.

&#x200B;

There is currently a desire to show a lot of willingness to fund the people through to now inevitable problems the COVID19 virus is going to bring with it , but to functionally do this without causing new problems is going to be very hard.   Zero percent interest rates are doing nothing in  the US,  and negative interest rates may come next.

&#x200B;

A matter that has me most concerned is I've now heard  multiple times from politicians talk of 'replacing income' - or universal incomes.  While I am certainly for people having money to eat and live, the idea of universal income often comes linked with the Modern Monetary Theory. This essentially predicts central banks can fund everything and there will be no  fall out from that.

&#x200B;

The main threat for this in the USA. Already the Fed has been very 'giving' with its QE flowing into the markets,  but if we see the barriers dropping and the Fed used to fund all liabilities directly this can have catastrophic effects. With the USD being the reserve currency,  this means this would quickly lead to problems for global  markets.

Over the past few weeks I've watched my portfolio drop by 30% and am realizing how unequipped I am to handle shocks like this.  I never bothered to learn basic portfolio hedging techniques (buying puts on indexes etc...) Am I really just supposed to sit on my ass and do nothing while I lose hundreds of thousands of dollars? 

I think the cult around maxims like 'time in the market' and 'you cant pick winners' is dangerous.  We're telling people to stay down and dumb and never learn anything beyond the bible of passive investing.

I see a lot of threads asking what people’s strategies are during this time, and I reply to the thread explaining I am continuing to put more cash in, which by definition means I am buying into the dip. Then a day later if the markets are down, I’ll get replies saying “the market is down x percent today you idiot you should’ve waited” or something along those words. However, this is the wrong way of thinking. You’re missing a point. By buying the dip, or as I like to call it, dollar cost averaging, I am not predicting that this is the “bottom”. I have no idea when the bottom is and nobody does. However what I DO know, from experience, is that stocks are very cheap right now. Also what I know from history is that the stock market has recovered from every crash in its history and has always hit new all time highs. I can say with 99.99% certainty that at some point in the future, whether it’s a year, 5 years, or a decade, that the market will once again hit a new all time high. I know that the prices I am paying now are significantly lower than what they’ll be in the future (assuming the company doesn’t suck). What I DON’T know is if it’s the BEST price I can get. There is no point for waiting to see what the best price is, because I’ll have no way of knowing what that price will be.
So in summary, while I have no clue how much lower these stock prices will go in the short term, I am extremely confident that 10 or so years from now they will be worth much more than they are now, and I’ll be glad I bought when I did. So please don’t say people are “wrong” for buying stocks at great prices when they could’ve waited and technically gotten a better price.

This time the crisis will be worse than that so it will fail, isn't it?

\***Helicopter Money**\*

During wars, governments pass laws that they couldn't pass during peacetime. During WW2 income tax was [expanded](https://time.com/4289687/1942-tax-day-history/) to take our sweet tendies from us.

This is a [war](https://time.com/5806657/donald-trump-coronavirus-war-china/) and trump is willing to pass any law to get elected. Americans are getting [free money](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488774-senate-negotiators-near-agreement-on-keeping-rebates-in-coronavirus-stimulus), and methinks this law is here to stay since it's popular to give people free money (surprise). This is essentially [UBI](https://www.thebalance.com/universal-basic-income-4160668) and support for UBI has been [growing substantially](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/463055-more-voters-support-universal-basic-income) recently.

While UBI gained through taxes shouldn't [cause inflation](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/20/16256240/mexico-cash-transfer-inflation-basic-income), [helicopter money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/helicopter-drop.asp) causes inflation. Our government is [broke](https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1241154891134857216) so they're definitely printing this shit.

&#x200B;

\***Supply Chain Disruption**\*

The coronavirus is pushing our supply chain [to the edge](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/supply-chains-and-coronavirus/608329/). This is simple supply and demand, decrease supply and demand must increase. The corona virus is growing [fast](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en) , I'm not optimistic supply chain issues will begin to improve until [May](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/03/15/americas-biggest-port-expects-trade-to-start-recovering-from-coronavirus-shock-by-may/#10a258a2b611) at the earliest.

&#x200B;

\***The FeDEraL REserVe**\*

Last (but definitely not least) the fed is interfering in the market. And we haven't seen [anything yet](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/03/20/us/20reuters-health-coronavirus-fed-lending.html), [just wait](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-fed-starts-buying-corporate-bonds-45-trillion-of-debt-could-be-eligible-says-bank-of-america-2020-03-19) there's [more to come](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-yield-control/as-treasury-yields-rise-investors-see-possibility-of-fed-yield-curve-control-idUSKBN216403).  From everything to [mortgages](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/ny-fed-buying-mbs-this-week/) to [municipal bonds](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/business/economy/federal-reserve-money-markets.html) to [the paper market](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/19/coronavirus-new-fed-loans-ease-strains-among-money-market-funds/2872957001/) to [the money markets](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-boosts-quantitative-easing-yield-caps-next-dow-jones/) the [traditional treasury QE](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-boosts-quantitative-easing-yield-caps-next-dow-jones/), the fed has to supply liquidity wherever it can as it disappears from companies drawing on credit lines at [record levels](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/how-cash-hungry-companies-could-bite-700-billion-out-of-banks) (greater than GFC). This is textbook fed inflation.

&#x200B;

\***Solution**\*

[Gold](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2019/03/16/why-gold-is-still-the-best-basis-for-money/#2ff66d855624).

&#x200B;

\***Why no calls**?\*

When inflation happens calls might look like a good idea, however my prediction is that gold will grow at a faster rate than other stocks due to inflation (and be losing money after inflation adjustments).

&#x200B;

\***When?**\*

It's time to invest more money in gold when these two things happen.

1. When [helicopter money](https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1241154891134857216) starts getting real serious.
2. The [dollar index](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy/charts) chart, specifically once we pass helicopter money laws. We're at all time highs now, the peak is nigh.

My guess is in 2-4 weeks.

&#x200B;

\***The Plays**\*

Your best option is $GLD. $GDX and $GDXJ if you want to risk it in the gold miners. Jnuggalos can fuck off.

**\*TL;DR\***

Did the world keel over and die? Did everyone sell their stocks and cry about it?

Nope, [we had the Roaring Twenties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties), which was one of the best decades ever. 

So if that's any indication, then we're going to have ANOTHER Roaring Twenties decade. 

I'm buying and HODLing as much stocks as I can afford in preparation for this huge decade of growth.",1,19
